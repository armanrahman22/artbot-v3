As a child and art student, he trained in Milan under a teacher who had been taught by the great Italian painter Titian himself, and who exposed him to the great works of Leonardo de Vinci and the Lombard artists. He moved to Rome in 1592, after certain quarrels resulted in the wounding of a police officer. Rome at the time was in a period if great expansion, and the many churches and palaces being built were all in need of paintings to decorate the walls. Caravaggio also moved to Rome during the Counter-Reformation, in which the Roman Catholic Church tried to stem the rising tide of Protestantism, and was commissioning many works to elevate the social status of the Church. \r\n\r\nHe arrived in Rome starving and destitute, and immediately began working for Giuseppe Cesari, the favorite painter of the Pope, and throughout the end of the 16th century his reputation as a great painter grew. His big break came in 1599, when he was commissioned to pain the Contarelli Chapel in Rome, which was finished in 1600. after which he began receiving many commissions, both public and private. Some of his works, being controversial in subject matter (his unacceptably vulgar realistic style) and models (one of his favorite models for the Virgin Mary was a prostitute), and some of his works were returned to be painted over or fixed. Others were returned entirely, but Caravaggio always had a public willing to snatch up any painting he produced. \r\n\r\nAs a street brawler, his police records and court proceedings fill many pages. In 1606, he killed a young man in a street fight and fled to Naples, where he was protected by the Colonna family. In 1608, he was arrested and put in jail for another brawl in Naples, but he managed to escape. In his flight from the law, he traveled through Milan, Syracuse, Sicily, Palermo, Malta, and Messina, continually receiving commissions. He returned to Naples to live with the Colonna family and seek a pardon from the Pope, and in 1606, an assassination attempt was made of his life, leaving his face permanently disfigured. \r\n\r\n In the summer of 1610, he took a boat from Naples to Rome, along with three paintings as an offering of peace, seeking a pardon from the Pope. He never arrived at his destination, having mysteriously died along the way. Although his artistic technique fathered the Baroque style, he was quickly forgotten after his death. It was not until the 1920’s that his body of work began to be fully received and appreciated.

In the period from 1599 to 1610, he created three paintings, which depict the final moment of this match: the winner holds in his hand the severed head of the vanquished. The picture \"David with the head of Goliath\"that we offer, was written in 1610, shortly before the death of the great painter.According to the Bible, the army of the Philistines came against the Israelites, the king which at that time was Saul. Three older brothers of David went to the defense of his people, leaving young David and elderly parents. A few days later the father sent a younger son to the camp, Israeli troops, instructing him to convey to the brothers food and learn how things work. Coming to brothers, David saw the Philistine giant, clad in armor out on the battlefield, he mocked the Israelites. The soldiers of Saul not dared to meet the giant, and then David spoke to the king with a request to allow him to oppose Goliath. The boy convinced the king that will be able to cope with the experienced warrior, and, abandoning the armor and weapons, went into the game with only one slingshot. The first released from her stone hit Goliath in the face of the giant collapsed dead. Terrified, the Philistines began to flee, and Saul's army won a quick victory.On the canvas, Caravaggio depicts David standing with the head of Goliath. After defeating the giant, he cut off the head of the enemy, to frighten the Philistine warriors. The figure of a man appears as if from impenetrable darkness, lit by the bright rays of the sun. David is dressed in a large white shirt, one sleeve of which the young man took off before the fight so that the fabric does not interfere how to bunt and homespun pants with drawstring. In his right hand clutching a sword with a thin, sharp blade, the left lifts the severed head of a defeated enemy.Despite the victory, David stood with the head of Goliath in his hand, not looks like a winner: Caravaggio painted on the boy's face of sadness and regret. This painting is very different from the other two paintings by the master on the same story. On canvas, dated 1599 year, we see a young man, busily bent over the giant — his thoughtful face facing the viewer in profile. \"David with the head of Goliath\" created by Caravaggio in 1607, compositionally similar to the later picture, however, the expression cowgirl can be called more wistful than tragic-sad.According to one version, the painting \"David with the head of Goliath\" in the image of a cowgirl artist depicted himself in his youth, and the head of Goliath — Caravaggio-portrait. As you know, Michelangelo, reputed to be from a young age a bully his entire life wandering due to the fact that not once broke the law. In this case, the pattern is interpreted as follows: David with the head of Goliath is a psychological conflict between experiencing guilt and need to punish, I (the image of Goliath) and punishing superego (the image of David). Today, the painting \"David with the head of Goliath\" can be seen in the Borghese Gallery, which is located in Rome (Italy)."},{"paintingTitle":"Medusa","artistName":"Caravaggio","artistContentId":186532,"paintingContentId":"2eed1b73-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1597, 60×55 cm • Oil, Canvas on wood","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1200/work/5a0/253572.jpg","paintingDescription":"Stories from Greek mythology was very popular among painters of the Late Renaissance. One of the characters in these myths, has attracted the attention of such famous artists as Rubens and Leonardo da Vinci, was a Gorgon — a monster with snakes instead of hair, framing a woman's face. According to legend, any living creature who looked Medusa in the eye, immediately turned to stone. This ability leaves no chance to its enemies and made the Gorgon practically invulnerable. Only Perseus, carrying out the instructions of the king Polidekt, managed to outwit the monster: he attacked Medusa, looking at her reflection in his brazen shield, and cut off her head. It turned out that even after death, Medusa was dangerous: her dead eyes has not lost its strength and was still able to turn anyone into a stone statue. Such we can see it in the painting by Caravaggio, depicting the severed head of Medusa defeated, but continued to bring death.Commissioned to create this canvas Caravaggio received in 1597 by cardinal Francesco Del Monte, who planned to present the Duke de Medici unusual gift: the picture on the subject of Ovid, written in a round shield. The artist enthusiastically set to work: he might have been motivated by a sense of rivalry with the great Leonardo, who also tried to transfer to canvas the events of the ancient myth. The picture \"Medusa\"that we invite you to read, Caravaggio was written in record time: a year later, in 1598, the work was presented to the Duke.As you know, the artist painted his canvas without preliminary sketches: x-ray analysis of the canvas does not find in them traces of pencil or charcoal. Head of Medusa painted by Caravaggio on canvas, stretched on a round wooden Board, was also created without a single sketch, so it was believed until the late twentieth century. Some doubts among critics was the fact that in one private collection was almost an exact copy of the painting \"Medusa\", however, to verify it was only in the 90-ies of the last century.The analysis showed that Caravaggio did a trial version of the picture: they were the head of Medusa, painted on the shield of smaller diameter. Under a layer of paint clearly visible outline of the coal, over which the master has left a light sketch with a brush. Experts managed to see what was hidden from prying eyes: painting-charcoal sketch suggested that the Medusa is depicted as a grotesque theatrical masks, but then the artist chose to give the monster human qualities.To portray on the convex surface of the shield beautiful female face, the artist used popular methods of copying with mirrors and glass. For the contemporaries of Caravaggio's painting \"Medusa\" was an undoubted masterpiece, despite the grim tone, the flow of blood and drama. Today, this masterpiece of fine art adorns the Uffizi gallery in Florence."},{"paintingTitle":"Judith killing of Holofernes","artistName":"Caravaggio","artistContentId":186532,"paintingContentId":"2eed1b74-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1599, 145×195 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy800/work/b23/306516.jpeg","paintingDescription":"There is still no description of this artwork.

Although he was dissuaded by his father at an early age to pursue his passions in painting, he left his hometown of Provence for Paris, in 1861. It was there that he met Camille Pisarro, a popular impressionist painter, who served as his mentor and guide. He began painting in the impressionistic style, but later began to structurally order what he saw and painted into simple forms and planes of color. He also began to simplify the forms he painted into shapes, such as a tree into a column. Unlike many of the painters of his day, who focused on one or maybe two subject styles, Cezanne concentrated on still lifes, portraits, landscapes, and nude studies. \r\n\r\nHe began slowly in Paris, as all of his submissions to the Paris Salon between the years of 1864 and 1869 went rejected. He finally successfully entered a submission into the Paris Salon in 1882, which was also his last. In 1895, there was an exhibition held of all of his own works, signifying his growing success as an artist, but that same year he moved back to his hometown of Provence, where he continued to work in isolation. \r\n\r\nCezanne was early depicted as a rude, shy, angry man, given to bouts of depression, and later in his life he withdrew into his paintings, spending long periods of time a recluse, painting in solitude. Although his paintings were not well-received by the public, who supposedly reacted with hilarity, outrage and sarcasm, and laughed at his art, young artists held him in high esteem, and often sought after him. Cezanne’s legacy is that he developed the practice of fracturing forms, which most immediately influenced the development of cubism, and later the foundation of modern art.

Father Tanguy the owner of an art shop, not only selling to the poor artists paints and brushes in debt, but bought them occasionally pictures, so they do not starve. Once he was in the shop a man came to ask about a painting by Cezanne on display in the window. \"A hundred francs? was disappointed buyer. A hundred francs for the painting of an unknown artist? I'm afraid that it's expensive. I could give him twenty-five francs. Madame Tanguy took still life with window. - Look, sir, it's a very big picture. Here are four Apple. Four apples are a hundred francs. You can spend only twenty-five. So why don't you buy the Apple one? The buyer looked at the picture and thought, he said: - Well, perhaps. Cut this Apple in all length of a cloth - buy it\". This story is probably legend, but very accurate and beautiful. Cezanne knew a handful of artists and a few Amateur collectors, and liked even less. If someone's got it now in the head to buy an Apple by Paul Cezanne, this madman still would have to be a millionaire. Cezanne loved apples: they have long maintained and not spoiled, they do not move, do not itch, do not sigh and do not violate the intended composition. For them it was easy to put a coin in one or two su – to place on the tablecloth in the right perspective. Neither the wife, nor son, nor friends, nor even cézanne himself did not write as often as apples. \"I want to amaze Paris with an Apple\", - said the artist.The most amazing thing is what made Cezanne in his reclusive still life, writing during the long weeks in solitude is a sense of wholeness with absolute geometric \"wrong.\" It is as if for each object created its own perspective, sending to hell Euclid and the Salon with its squeaky standards of correctness of art. In 1899, when cézanne says apples to oranges, floppy salon judges still not recovered from fainting caused by audacity Manet. Honorary exhibition in the hallowed halls of the Salon will take place only after 6 years, and \"Olympia\" transported to the Louvre just after 7. And then this crazy Provencal already throws the apples in the remaining canons of academic painting. He says that he sees the rays emanating from each object that \"objects interpenetrate and complement, and never ceases to live... they understand each other so we, through looks and words\".

Unlike many of his fellow artists who doubt the value of their own works, Cezanne periodically felt, and sometimes said out loud that he is a genius and his paintings will begin to understand much soon after his death. Even friends, the future artists, the Impressionists, who performed his revolutionary exhibition, afraid of the wild painting by Cezanne. Critics of Cezanne and without them indiscriminately despised, and Cezanne was up to their events looked deliberately and excessively provocative.Critics find in this series of 5 paintingsnot much confirmed philosophical and symbolic meanings. There have been attempts to consider here the picturesque allegory of the battle, from which Cezanne comes out the winner was a variation on a theme cards of fate and the choice that man makes himself granted him the choice possibilities. Fans of psychological connotations seen in the story of the confrontation between Paul and his father, which lasted until the death of the old man and the Cubists, Cezanne declared its predecessor, argued that in these figures no more warmth than the still life that the entire painting is nothing more than \"the cylinder, sphere and cone\". But it is unlikely that Cezanne is so simple – it is solely interested in, he would have never left the Studio and just ordered a kilo of apples for a week. In fact, the artist was able to keep in mind all of these meanings, or none at all – is much more important potential challenge to the audience: to connect to the creation of meanings, to create and to strain to understand. With more confidence we can assume that especially attracted Cezanne in the playing process: the tense confrontation and the work of the heart with complete immobility. That is what Paul loved the mountains and apples for stillness. These are the models he wanted, going out when tired wife on the 20th session of posing suddenly moved and ruined everything. He dreamed that people were like apples. And finally fleeing from the loud, bustling Paris to the estate of the father Mrs. de Bouffan, he found his apples. Local farmers, gardener, maids, they knew how to be truly still and focused, they lived is measured and thoughtful, in the same rhythm with nature, with the sun.While working on the series for more than five years, Cezanne started with a huge two-meter canvas and multi-figure compositions (1), the second picture has reduced the number of figures to four (2), and on the other left only the most important – two rivals, a bottle, which they most likely play the table and card.

And it's not in the palette and not in the technique.Cézanne couldn't stand theories of art – it's like he was always afraid of accidentally get caught up in one anothers slender worldview. In the last 20 years of life, reducing communication with artists, writers and family almost to epistolary, he happily closed in a small Studio and started looking for his \"promised land\". In the paintings of the Impressionists who tried to catch the momentary and temporary, Cezanne did not see the monumentality and philosophical thoroughness, which will these pictures ever be on the walls of the Louvre. No, he had long been dreaming about fame and the Louvre – it is just painful wants to perform several important tasks: to give a sense of the beauty of places, so close to wonderful and exciting for him personally to convey only its own emotions and feelings from the sight and to see the image from all the excess and reveal through him the logic of nature, to find the timeless, the eternal – something that is present in the paintings of the old masters.And leaving daily, dozens of times, from morning till evening to write the Montagne Sainte-Victoire from different angles, he's not looking for the nuances of lighting at different times of day and year, he is looking for the essence of the mountains. He began to write immediately, spends hours in silence staring at the landscape while it has not come to a vision of the future picture.

If the artist most in life cared to place contemporary art performances and appeared in countless \"isms\" of the twentieth century. But when Cezanne says that without it there would be Matisseand Picassoit is very correct: cézanne, like no other must have felt like a part of the history of art, lived inside this story and created beings, not born as if in the real world, and picturesque. These beings are subject not to the laws of anatomical and compositional: they are drawn up when required by the rhythm pattern, they fill their bodies the desired volume and emptiness, they bend and lean to where directs their creative hand of the artist.Bathers and bathers by cézanne, after 40 years of study of this topic would be typed on a decent modern French resort. The first picture swimming was strongly associated with a youthful sketches that Paul did in notebooks during long walks with friends around the neighborhood of his native city of the axe, and with drawings of the Louvre of antique statues. The reclusive cézanne in the last years of his life in AIX asked why he does not use sketches of the female Nude for their \"Bathing\". Cezanne joked: \"I'm too old to undress women\". But actually now he is no longer needed in sketches – he silently and stubbornly walked all day through meadows and drank from morning till night the sultry southern air, warmed to the laws of nature, by attaining which, could easily be applied to all living things. He wrote all his \"The large bathers\" for 6 – 7 years, never considered them complete, improving and growing in each of these paintings? Almost physical sensation of rapid growth, providing a diagonal of trees, shimmering, translucent colors and illegible the faces of the heroines. In this sense, Cezanne anticipates not only the cubist experiments of his followers, but also fantastic ideas artists of the XX century to raise the product as a flower or as a tree.Author: Anna Sidelnikova"},{"paintingTitle":"Still life with tulips in a vase","artistName":"Paul Cezanne","artistContentId":215455,"paintingContentId":"2f54ddf4-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1892, 72×42 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1200/work/019/228235.jpg","paintingDescription":"There is still no description of this artwork.

Nothing, absolutely nothing foretold that she would become one of several paintings sold here, on this controversial exhibition.Terribly funny and famous critic Louis Leroy (the Impressionists invented the nickname in mockery), is already written his condescending nerve-a review. In this poisonous journalistic reporting \"the House of the hanged man\" is coming to the exhibition of artist Vincent last straw on the path to madness. But, oddly enough, Leroy in relation to the Cezanne is very stingy on the details. No virtuoso comparisons with the Wallpaper sketches and painters, renovate the fountain, no more comments about pattern and color. It happened then always with Cezanne who really could explain what it hates or adores.Once the exhibition came a middle-aged man with an adult son. Seeing \"House of the hanged man\", he stops, frowns. Explaining to his son his unpleasant impression from the paintings, the man is trying to find the exact arguments. The longer he talks, the slower and sound less heard his words, the there is more interest in look. \"No, we nothing understand! - suddenly exclaimed the stranger. - Some important features incorporated in the paintings of this artist. It should be presented in my gallery\" (quote from the book Henri Perruso \"Life of Cezanne\"). This collector count Armand Doria. He immediately puts 300 francs for his hit picture. Of course, he can't even really explain what begins to love cézanne.Pass 25 years, but nothing will change. Another count Isaac Camondo buying the painting for 6200 francs, still don't understand what to do. \"Oh yeah, I bought the painting that have never recognized! But I risk nothing: I have a letter signed Claude Monet that gave me your word of honor that this canvas is destined to become famous. Come and see me and I'll show you this letter. I keep it in a small pocket, pinned on the reverse side of the canvas, especially for those who think I'm damaged mind with his \"House of the hanged man\".That felt, but could not explain to his son the Comte Doria, he knew Monet, but did not explain the count of Paris, since then, tried to explain differently. The Surrealists, who regarded cézanne as one of its precursors, you can see in the picture is first and foremost a well-crafted sinister space and a set of symbols and metaphors: the house, as if suspended in the air, eroding horizontal crack on the wall. \"The artist, like every person, has a tendency to return to the scene of the crime\"- writes Andre Breton. And recalls Cezanne other paintings, recreating the tense atmosphere of threat and death: \"Abandoned house\", \"The house with cracked wall\", \"A young man with a skull\" and finally,  \"The card players\".Matisse generally calls cézanne an artist's \"House of the hanged man\" and \"card Players\" and puts these works on one level: Junior's debut picture Mature and powerful long-term cycle. \"Matisse was attracted by the structure of these works – or architecture, if I may say so: the fact that they are both well-built, can be seen immediately. Both of these songs, V-shape, formed in one case by the walls of buildings, and the other with the feet of the players in the cards\"- says Alex Danchev, cézanne biographer. But the General alignment, the geometrical accuracy of the \"House of the hanged man\" is composed of many deliberate inaccuracies of perspective: near and distant plans, there are so, whatever the overall scenic objective of the work. The branches of a distant tree appear in front of the house, standing much closer, it is not clear (at every new look different), whether the cost of the house in the distance next to or one after the other. Yes, and the house of the hanged man nothing to do with the direct term has not.It is this harmony of irregularities made probably count Doria buy painting for many years and consider her in my gallery.Author: Anna Sidelnikova"},{"paintingTitle":"Mount Sainte Victoire mountain (the Mount of Saint Victoria)","artistName":"Paul Cezanne","artistContentId":215455,"paintingContentId":"2f54ddfa-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1906, 63×83 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy800/work/373/228293.jpg","paintingDescription":"There is still no description of this artwork.

It's really weird. Because the textbook biographies of the artist is difficult to find another figure, so graciously and consistently expunged from his life, from his personal list of \"important\". But 29 pictures prove at least the fact that cézanne met with the wife more frequently than say her haters. Besides posing Cezanne – the test is not for the weak. He demanded complete stillness, was very slow and lost his temper when the model changed pose. Tore the canvas or throwing it in a corner, having lost the necessary contact with the model.The mother and sister of the artist was sure that Hortense wants to rip off the Fields as sticky, she married for convenience. Friends of Cezanne often wrote each other letters that Paul suffers much from his wife. And as such a sincere man as \"our Paul\", could ugorazdit to marry such. Hortense was 19, and Cezanne 30 when they met and began to live together. This is after the death of her husband, Madame cézanne sell some of his paintings and be able to live on this money, nothing to worry and sometimes large sums by gambling it away in casinos. And while she was young, money was never enough. They raised the little boy huddling in a small room, and tried to survive for 200 francs, which were sent Cezanne father. Several years passed and they had almost ceased to live together, while retaining the complex, no clear communication. Every time taking portrait of the wife, Cezanne's like Dating a new person. It is surprisingly not similar to itself from the neighboring portrait: she is a different face shape, different mood, age, and facial expression. But Hortense always recognizable and never alluring, as the wife of Renoirfor example, each of the portraits. Cezanne's wife is not flattered, he's not interested. Cezanne's wife is studying, like an Apple or like a mountain. Rilke, who visited the exhibition Cezanne in 1907, was watching the visitors and wrote to his wife: \"But women feel so beautiful when they go past; (...) freeze for a moment near the \"one of those touching conventional portraits of Madame Cezanne\" don't look, but if you study this ugly painting, believing it only good for yourself\". Picture \"Madame Cezanne in a yellow chair\" - one of four in the so-called \"cycle in the red dress\". Anotheris kept in the Museum of the art Institute of Chicago second in Sao Paula, Brazil. And finally, the largest and most detailedthe version in the Metropolitan Museum in new York. And if not dress and hairstyle, it would be hard to guess in these four portraits of the same woman. Most likely, the three small paintings were sketches and warm-up, attempt to combine red color, yellow chairs, blue walls in the same space. Last, new York, coloristic complex, dizzying swaying in his term – more like Cezanne still life. The artist Elizabeth Murray especially admired the final picture is \"red dress\" standing in front of her at the Metropolitan Museum: \"She's actually not sitting in that chair, and sometimes it seems that the weight of two hundred pounds, or she suddenly turns into a hollow dress sticking out of his arms and head. It is impossible to say, she stands or sits so motionless figure, though inclined. The image embodied the uncertainty, the deliberate \"nesochetanie\" of all things... I mean that is a complex tangle: it is clear that Hortense is looking for her husband without contempt, but says, \"you Old fool.\" And all of these emotions, existential angst, feelings on canvas\".

On it the artist has depicted all that he was important in my life at that time: himself, his beloved wife Bella, and Vitebsk. Throwing gravity, happy lovers fly over the city, arm in arm. Underneath is lined and belted endless fences Witbeck – in the same year, marched in a short period of enchantment new authority will arrange for these unique fences, graffiti, painted them to the anniversary of the October revolution.People often fly in the paintings of Chagall. He particularly liked go to the flight of the lovers. In such cases we see the literal embodiment of the metaphors \"flying from happiness\". In the book of memories of Bella Chagall's \"Burning lights\" is a description of how Marc Chagall sends two of them flying: \"You rush to the blade, trembling under your hand. Dip the brush. Gushing red, blue, white, black. Drag me into a whirlpool of colors. And suddenly you're off the ground and dragging me with you.\".However, flying with Chagall, not only from happiness. Flight in his paintings is not even overcome earth's gravity, and the simple and natural state of man. Whether the happy lovers, circus acrobats, Nude or Jew flying over Vitebsk. This is the feature of the paintings of Chagall – they are unrestrained flight of fancy, but absolutely fantastic and really authentic. Special effect painting \"Above the city\" created a touching combination of home and outside life. Piquant detail – look to the bottom left corner. What happens under the Vitebsk fence? Absolutely, someone pulling his pants, defecate. What a surprise, one of the most romantic paintings of Chagall! That's the romanticism of it, that's the beauty of that one. And mission, and bare bottom, and elegant outfit to Bella, which, too, is represented not as an abstract idea the sublime of the beautiful ladies. If the figure of the artist comisioane, Bella wrote a soft rounded lines. It is more than real lace ruffles on the dress, the details are carefully drawn shoes... Later art historians will wonder how it was possible to create an endless Symphony of love, dedicating it to the real woman that live close by for many years. Probably, it needs that special look that allows you to see in the beloved at the same time and in the detail lace ruffle dress and the flight of her soul.Author: Alain Esaulova"},{"paintingTitle":"I and my village","artistName":"Marc Chagall","artistContentId":202355,"paintingContentId":"2fc10d41-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1911, 191×150.5 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1200/work/664/162439.jpg","paintingDescription":"Chagall was painting a picture \"I and my village\" in Paris. Its plot is constructed on a mirror image. On the right we see the profile of the artist, on the contrary, the profile of a cow's muzzle. The artist hands her a bundle of branches and flowers, which is interpreted as the tree of life. At the top of the picture of the mirrored profile, like a bridge, connected the image of Vitebsk. Chagall and the cow look, \"sniff\" to each other. Interesting method of \"nesting dolls\" allowed the artist to portray inside the head of the animal a separate scene with a milkmaid and a cow. In the center there is a circle connecting all the elements together and symbolizing the cycle of life. Around this circle and the unfolding events of the painting: houses of Vitebsk, including standing on their own roofs, a milkmaid with a cow, the inverted woman catching her man with a scythe. The bright inverted figure of a woman there is a force, it is interpreted as a symbol of fertility. She like runs away from that depicted in dark tones of a man with a scythe. Not a reference to the grim Reaper? However, this chase does not create a sense of threat, she looks like a natural part of the circle, a natural part of life. The picture fully shows characteristic of Chagall, the ability to connect the everyday and the supernatural.In the painting \"I and the village\" felt the echoes of Fauvism – the laws of perspective scrapped as unnecessary, and the sizes are not concerned with the conformity of reality, cubism – the division into sectors, decomposition, impressionism is an unusual use of color. This painting is the most full of symbols: signs (Kosa, the Church, the tree of life), shape (circle, matryoshka). Many researchers define its genre as \"domestic symbolism\". But it is more correct to say that connecting with different areas of painting, the picture is still beyond any of them.

Attributes more than recognizable – at the top right of the Eiffel tower, at the bottom, the Paris Opera, the ceiling which was painted by Chagall in 1963, by order of the Minister of culture of France Andre Malraux.However, the house in the upper left corner suspiciously reminiscent of Vitebsk, and turned to their side profile in the background says that nothing and nobody could dislodge from the heart artist of his hometown. The picture strikes a daring color palette. Bright, rich colors set the tone for the painting. The picture Vava bright and shining, her face the color of spring leaves, the colors of youth and life, with shimmering purple dress pleases the eye, from behind Vava Peeps scarlet face of his horse. Pablo Picasso spoke about the ability Chagall to hold a brush: \"When Matisse dies, the only artist who knows what color, will remain Chagall. I'm not crazy about his roosters, donkeys, flying violinists and other folklore, but his canvases are really painted, not just painted\".Chagall do with extraordinary ease and grace uses color. Zelenaya Wawa in this sense, is not alone. Not to mention \"The green violinist\", \"Jew in green\",\"Bride with blue face\" (a groom with a green!). And the colors in the image lovers – generally a separate page in the work of Chagall. It seems that he deliberately experimented, trying to figure out what colors are more suitable for other images of love. To answer this question, the artist painted \"Green lovers\", \"Blue lovers\", \"Pink lovers\",\"Gray lovers\".In the portrait of Vava by Marc Chagall used the symbol of pregnancy, which repeatedly turned in his work. On the woman's stomach, the image they embraced and merged in a passionate kiss of lovers. It symbolizes respect Chagall and his second wife, to their relationship, like a child who should cherish and nurture with love and care. Extremely contradictory attitude towards Waw had art historians and relatives of Marc Chagall. It criticized for the fact that it has transformed the artist into a business project. And the son walked from Virginia haggard David many years later, speaking of the last wife of his father, exclusively uses the word \"she\". But to protect Chagall from all that prevented him from writing, and create ideal conditions for work, as had become his favorite, Waw was a success. And if as a key argument in defense of Vava to turn to the words of Marc Chagall: \"In our lives, as in the artist's palette, there is only one color that can give the meaning of life and art – the color of love,\" that certainly would have to agree that this color he possessed masterful. \"Portrait of Vava\" is one of the brightest (in all senses) evidence.Author: Alain Esaulova"},{"paintingTitle":"The betrothed and Eiffel tower","artistName":"Marc Chagall","artistContentId":202355,"paintingContentId":"2fc10d44-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1913, 77×70 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/orig/work/517/263977.jpg","paintingDescription":"Picture \"The betrothed and Eiffel tower\" a favorite is the story of Marc Chagall: flying in love. In the bride can easily learn of his eternal Muse, his wife Bella, in the image of the groom Chagall has painted himself. People who have overcome the force of gravity– a frequent heroes of the paintings of Marc Chagall.Although not entirely true to say that in the paintings of Chagall overcome gravity. It is not even about coping, which involves struggle and effort. For Chagall depicts figures flying natural as breathing. We don't overcome air resistance in order to inhale and exhale. The characters in the paintings of Chagall does not overcome the force of gravity – it is in their space is simply not valid. \"The betrothed and Eiffel Tower\" shows us the two favorite cities of Chagall. It's hard not to notice the Eiffel tower – the bright blue recognizable, it fills the background. And under it – Vitebsk. Lower right corner leaves no doubt of the roof of the city huddled under the flying angel and the soaring tower. \"Artist in Paris\"– said Marc Chagall. And confessing to Paris in his infinite love and trying to say about him the best that you can, exclaimed: \"Paris, you're my Vitebsk!\". Indeed, in his paintings wonderfully side by side the two cities.Cock, bull, RAM, goat and other animals often appear in his paintings. Including goat-violinistto become one of the trademarks of Chagall. Researchers see in these images biblical roots, appealing, on the one hand, to animals as a sacrifice and symbol of atonement, on the other, the sign of purity and harmony. Optimistic, light, joyful mood described picture more like the second interpretation. Moreover, note that the images of animals, particularly goats and a rooster, often accompanied by Chagall lovers (there is even a picture \"The lovers and the red rooster\"). And in this context suggests a reference to the \"Song of songs\" as the hymn of love and unity with nature lovers. Through the artist's work is the archetype of pregnancy. The violinist is depicted as inside of a cock. Like we see in the picture \"Motherhood\" – the child in the womb. In \"The cattle dealer\" the foal pictured in the belly of the Mare. Not so straightforward this image is used in \"the Betrothed and Eiffel tower\" and \"Portrait Of Vava\"where in the belly of the woman pictured in love. They symbolize growing inside force uniting of two into one, and the care with which a woman can nurture and protect love. In the \"Engaged\" inside the cock, tear from the land of the loving couple and support them, happy and dreamy, surrounded by the colourful diversity of the world Chagall (in which angels and goats, double the sun is shining, and the roads directly connect Vitebsk and Paris) depicts the Fiddler, the symbol of creativity. For Marc Chagall, as none other, that love was the driving force of life and art. He always said that the most important thing in life, the strong in life is love. And that power which brings love and tolerate the lovers of real space into a place of endless, brought him inspiration. What would be the name of an earthly woman, this force has not been worn.Author: Alain Esaulova"},{"paintingTitle":"La Tour Eiffel","artistName":"Marc Chagall","artistContentId":202355,"paintingContentId":"2fc10d45-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1934, 100×81.8 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1200/work/c3a/560592.jpg","paintingDescription":"There is still no description of this artwork.

His chosen one was Valentina Brodsky, whom he called Vava. The relationship of the artist with his first wife is generally spoken in glowing terms, while Vava is openly disliked by art critics. The second wife is said to be not so much his beloved woman as Chagall’s manager , and she practically forced him to break off relationships with many close people. However, Bella stayed in his biographies forever as his only muse and inspirer. But can’t one have another love in his life? Even when the second one differs from the first one. The kind, real and tragic love to Bella was in the Chagall’s heart till the end of his days. Nevertheless, he also loved Vava, but a little bit in another way. She helped him to feel comfortable and cozily; she was the woman he wrote of, “I see only you living with me and for me”. He tenderly painted her and himself at her side. Perhaps, the only important difference was the entourage: the artist most often portrayed Bella in the environment of the native Vitebsk landscapes, while the background for the portraits of Vava was usually Parisian.Five years before his death in 1980, Marc painted the Artist and His Bride canvas, in which he seems to summarize his entire long life. Everything seems transparent here, wrapped in a haze, except for a bouquet of bright red flowers in the foreground. In the artist's face, the features of himself can be easily seen. The background is divided into two parts; it was dedicated to his most favourite cities: Paris on the left, and Vitebsk on the right. An acrobat and musicians, a mother with her child and a couple of lovers can be seen here, all of them are like live memories. The bride of the artist kind of hovers above the ground again. Who is she? Bella or Vava? It’s likely that they both are rolled into one."},{"paintingTitle":"Walk","artistName":"Marc Chagall","artistContentId":202355,"paintingContentId":"2fc10d49-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1918, 169.6×163.4 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1200/work/9bc/322230.jpeg","paintingDescription":"Perhaps, it is difficult to find a person who is not familiar with the expression \"Love gives wings\". Almost all of us know the feeling of lightness that come with love: it feels like floating in the air — another moment, and a light wind will carry you somewhere up and beyond the horizon... Marc Chagall was the artist who managed to transfer the essence of this state on the canvas. Most of his paintings you can see characters floating in the air, their faces glowing with happiness and love.For Marc Chagall's familiarity with Bella Rosenfeld was significant: this woman appeared, many works of the great masters, including the painting \"Walk\". She was his lighthouse, Muse, model and a faithful wife. Art historians have estimated that its image can be seen more than 2 thousands of paintings by Chagall. Big fan of Russian Proverbs, the artist beat them in their works. So, the painting of Marc Chagall \"Walk\" we see the interpretation of the proverb about the bird in the hand and pie in the sky. Young loving couple out on a country walk. They found a cozy place on the outskirts of the city: a green lawn, the branches of the tree, giving shade, scenic views of the city from rising above the pink walls of the Church.

The artist has depicted himself steadily standing on the ground and firmly holding the hand of a beloved woman, wzmiuw up on a whim. In his right hand is sitting quietly the bird thus Chagall seems to be saying to the viewer that there are times when one does not need to make a choice between a titmouse and a crane from a famous proverb: he can take everything from life.\"Walk\" is not a single painting by Marc Chagall, part of a triptych. The first part is the painting \"Double portrait\", showing preparations for flight: in it the artist has depicted himself sitting on the shoulders of Bella. The other part — \"Above the city\" — shows the viewer the joint flight. The artist used this technique as a kind of metaphor, symbolizing the freedom from earth's gravity that gives a person love.Today these works live their lives. The painting \"Above the city\" is in the Tretyakov gallery. \"Double portrait\" was donated by the artist in 1949, the Paris Museum of arts. Paris.

And all three paintings – \"Madonna with child and St. Anna\", \"La Gioconda\"and \"Saint John The Baptist\" - the artist could not finish. Leonardo continued to work on them, dealing with new and new thin layers of paint, adding detail and bringing to perfection a smoky sfumato effect. The painting \"Saint John the Baptist\", which is considered to be the last work of da Vinci, recognized by most critics the pinnacle of the artist's skill in this technique.This picture also represents a sample drawn amazing play of light and shadow. John the Baptist seemingly envelops the darkness, approaching from all sides. Thus the figure of the Saint, seems filled with an inner radiance, because to accurately determine the source of Golden light, snatching her out of the darkness, impossible. \"John the Baptist\", as, indeed, most of the works of the artist, to this day remains the subject of many disputes, assumptions and theories. No experts doubt only one – the authorship of Leonardo. In particular, the Secretary of the cardinal of Aragon Antonio de Beatis in his diary writes about visiting the Studio \"the most excellent painter of our time\" On 10 October 1517 and talks about the three paintings, including \"John the Baptist\". After the death of da Vinci, the painting became part of the collection of king Francis I at Fontainebleau. In 1625 English king Charles I swapped \"John the Baptist\" Louis XIII inviting the French monarch the \"Holy family\" and Titian \"Portrait Of Erasmus Of Rotterdam\" Holbein. In 1649, a collection of Charles was sold out, and Leonardo was in the hands of a German banker Eberhard Abacha. \"John the Baptist\" returned to France in 1661, and again under the tutelage of the country's ruler, Louis XIV. After the revolution, the painting took place in the Louvre, where it remains to this day.Before and after da Vinci: how artists have portrayed John the Baptist\nJohn the Baptist, one of the most iconic biblical figures, for a long time portrayed only icons. Painters often treated to two scenes from the life of the Saint the baptism of Christ and execution of John (1, 2, 3). The same attributes of the prophet had long dark hair, beard, clothes made of coarse camel hair and a thin cross made of reeds. Also often portrayed John the Baptist with upraised forefinger of the right hand. This gesture symbolized the prophecy of the coming of the Messiah. In the painting was another popular motive: baby John often appears next to the infant Christ and the virgin (1, 2).Special attention is given picture \"Baptism Of Christ\" Andrea del Verokko. Taking to his Studio bastard da Vinci, Verokko hardly imagine that this boy will become a genius painter and inventor. However, the artistic talent in Leonardo he clearly saw and allowed the student to write the figure of the angel in the corner \"Baptism of Christ\". This angel is considered the first preserved scenic work of da Vinci. Four decades later, Leonardo will write his \"St. John the Baptist,\" which will begin a new pictorial era. Giving the character recognizable attributes, the artist has made it infinitely far from the canonical images of stern bearded ascetic. The face of this, John, is framed by Golden curls, can be equally both male and female. It is believed that the androgynous heroes of the later works of da Vinci symbolize the transition of European painting to mannerism.After Leonardo's John the Baptist, European artists begin to portray the beardless, half-naked, wholesome and youthful energy (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The exception was, perhaps, the El Greco paintings in which the image of the prophet will be close to traditional. The mystery of the painting by Leonardo da Vinci\nAccording to a less popular theory, which hold lovers search puzzles and secret codes in the works of da Vinci, this painting depicts not John the Baptist, and Hermes Trismegistus, who stood at the head of the Pantheon of magical-occult teachings called \"Hermeticism\". Saying that Leonardo, struck the secret knowledge of the \"pressure hull\" (the main books Hermetists), was not only to apply them in practice, but also to encrypt in his paintings.Proponents of this theory claim that with this knowledge, da Vinci was able to stay ahead of the science of his time, and to create drawings of structures, building of which at that time was simply impossible. Hermeticism, which served as the main doctrine of the European alchemists, and one of his sacred texts – the \"emerald tablet\" - a source of the famous occult axiom: \"That which is below is similar to what is above\". Supporters of the version that the painting by Leonardo depicts Hermes Trismegistus, believe that a gesture pointing to the sky with a finger symbolises this axiom.Assistant, student... lover?\nGian Giacomo Caprotti Yes Oreno reason received from Leonardo nickname Salaino (\"devil\"). The boy, whose father was the caretaker of the vineyard da Vinci became the apprentice and pupil of the artist along with Francesco Melzi at the age of 10 years and stayed with the master for more than two and a half decades. In childhood by Giacomo actually was a real devil, that much got away with it thanks to the angelic appearance. Giorgio Vasari described him as \"graceful, handsome youth with fine curly hair, who loved Leonardo\". Da Vinci himself was given to his disciple much less flattering characteristics: \"a liar, a thief, stubborn and a glutton\". Salai really is constantly stealing everything that wasn't nailed down (including your teacher), but almost never managed to catch.Salai and Francesco Melzi accompanied Leonardo in his travels to Rome and to France. At that time Melzi was the principal assistant and personal Secretary of the artist, among other things, he was preparing for publication the records of da Vinci. Salai was described as a simple servant and messenger. Many researchers of creativity of da Vinci's agree that Leonardo kept Giacomo near me because of a romantic relationship that connects them. In favor of this say a few erotic drawings of da Vinci, including an image of a naked student in a pose almost identical to the one in which depicts John the Baptist. The most common version, Salai was the model for this painting. A group of Italian scientists went further and found evidence that da Vinci's apprentice, dressed in a dress that excites the imagination of visitors of the Louvre enigmatic smile of Mona Lisa. The Louvre, by the way, this theory categorically rejects.Salai left Leonardo and left France in 1518. He returned to Milan and began working in the same vineyard where previously he worked, his father. Next year half of the vineyard was his property, according to the last will of da Vinci. Student Leonardo was an artist, though not too outstanding. He wrote under the pseudonym of Andrea Salai and created some pretty good copies of the works of da Vinci. The most famous painting of Giacomo became \"Monna The Bath\" the so-called \"Nude Mona Lisa\", the basis for which could serve as a lost painting by Leonardo. Salai claimed that da Vinci left him some of his paintings, however, numerous studies have allowed to establish that belonged to Giacomo paintings are only replicas that are likely to have written it himself (this includes a copy of the \"Mona Lisa\" from the Prado Museum and \"St. John the Baptist\", which is stored in Milan).Of the prophets – the gods\nThe painting \"Saint John the Baptist\" is associated with another famous work of da Vinci \"Bacchus\". However, despite the fact that she attributed to Leonardo, disputes about authorship are still underway. Some researchers believe that \"Bacchus\" was written by one of leonardesco surviving sketch artist. Among the possible authors of the painting are called Cesare da Sesto, Marco d Oggiono, Francesco Melzi, Cesare and Bernadino. That picture was created based on sketch da Vinci there is no doubt. This is evidenced by the identical posture of the character and position of his hands. Here only the sketch of da Vinci depicts John the Baptist. How did the Christian prophet became a Greek God? According to one version, which ascribes the authorship of the \"Bacchus\" da Vinci originally called the painting \"St. John the Baptist in the wilderness.\" Moreover, the prophet was depicted in the image is far from canonical, he was still completely naked. A scholar and patron Cassiano dal Pozzo, who saw the work at Fontainebleau in 1625, noted that, despite the consummate artistic skills of the author, depicted in the painting, the man could not be John the Baptist, because such an unseemly way, not cause of religious awe and pious thoughts. John the Baptist was Bacchus, between 1683 and 1693 years, that is, without the participation of Leonardo da Vinci. At the same time the picture appeared traditional of Dionysus leopard skin, and his head the unknown artist had decorated with a wreath of grape vines. There is not a very popular theory that the author of \"Bacchus\" is Salai, who served as the model for the sketch of da Vinci, as \"John the Baptist\".Author: Eugene Sidelnikov"},{"paintingTitle":"Lady with an ermine.

I think that this picture is the best of all created by Leonardo da Vinci. She just not lucky enough to become as famous as the \"Mona Lisa\": it is found not in the Louvre, its not stolen, its loss did not write for several months on the front pages of all Newspapers. Curiously, attributed to Leonardo da Vinci's authorship \"Lady with an ermine\" for a long time been in doubt as the person depicted on the canvas girls. Disputes that periodically flare up until now, when technical tools of the digital age allow you to explore the painting from a new angle.While it is worth to dwell on the fact that the portrait depicts Cecilia (Cecilia) Gallerani, the mistress of the Duke of Milan Ludovico Sforza the mother of his son Cesare. The artist has taken care to ensure that as little detail distracts the viewer from the young and fresh beauty of the model. Da Vinci painted her in a simple dress and jewelry left in the girl only thread of black pearls. Even the slicked-down hair of Cecilia, it seems, serve exactly this purpose (this hairstyle with braid and tightly covering her face with strands of hair was styled Isabella Of Aragon called coazone). Images of model, was the innovation of Leonardo, the portraits represented for the most part, hammered profiles. And even in this unusual pose, the artist managed to emphasise the lively character of the young model, who supposedly listens to an unseen interlocutor.Hands Gallerani holding a white animal, which is considered to be an ermine. There are several interpretations of what the animal symbolizes. Traditionally, the winter white ermine is considered a symbol of purity and innocence, this was the legend that he would rather die than to stain the white fur. According to another version, the animal serves as a hint of bond girl with Lodovico Sforza, who in 1488 was admitted to the Order of the ermine and included the animal in his arms. In addition, there is a perception that, being a big fan of puzzles and codes da Vinci with ermine encrypted on the canvas of the surname Gallerani (in ancient Greek, the whole family of mustelids was called \"gale\"). Milan Muse\nCecilia Gallerani was born in 1473 in a large family that could not boast of neither wealth nor nobility. The girl had six brothers, along with whom she studied languages, she was fluent in Latin, sang and played musical instruments, wrote poetry. Her education and talent combined with comely appearance and attracted the attention of Ludovico Sforza, nicknamed Il Moro, in whose service consisted of father, Gallerani. Probably Duke of Milan was the reason for breaking an engagement with a certain Cecilia Giovanni Stefano Visconti, to whom she was promised in marriage even at the age of 10 years.Gallerani was the lover of Sforza at the age of about 16-17 years. According to eyewitnesses, the girl always accompanied the Duke, he was genuinely attached to her and settled her in his castle, providing it several rooms. Cecilia remained in the castle even after Sforza married Beatrice d'este and Lodovico sometimes secretly go to the room of his mistress, which at the time was expecting his baby. Of course, all this could not hide from the attention the legitimate wife of the Duke, Beatrice jealous of his rival and, eventually, was forced to sever ties with Cecilia. After Gallerani gave birth to a son, Cesare, Sforza gave her in marriage to the bankrupt Lodovico di Brambilla, count Bergamini, and gifted to the Palace. Married Cecilia gave birth to four children and has become a very popular figure in Milan due to the fact that he opened one of Europe's first literary salons. The marriage did not affect entrainment woman, she not only continued to write herself, and began to collect in his house philosophers, theologians and poets, who called her his Muse. Cecilia appeared in the court of the sforzas, especially after the death of his wife, his in 1497. The former lover of the Duke, together with his new mistress, Lucrezia Crivelli supported and took care of Il Moro after a loss. Cecilia died at the age of 63, survived and Lodovico Sforza, and Leonardo da Vinci, made it famous for centuries.Author, author!\nThe painting \"Lady with an ermine\" was subject to two detailed laboratory studies aimed, in particular, to confirm the authorship of Leonardo da Vinci. The results of the first conducted by the Warsaw scientists, was published in 1955. The second study along with the restoration was carried out in 1992 in the laboratories of the National gallery of art in Washington under the leadership of a specialist in the conservation of art objects David Bulla. The scientist was stunned by the mastery of Leonardo, he later said that a careful study of the picture gives the impression that the artist started to write your model with a skeleton, adding flesh and clothes only after you understand the mechanics of her body. That the author of the painting \"Lady with an ermine\" is da Vinci, evidenced by several factors. First, there is documentary evidence that the artist was familiar with Cecilia Gallerani (moreover, they also had tender friendship) and painted her portrait. Secondly, in favor of authorship Leonardo says the color scheme of the picture, the play of light and shadow, and rotate the head model in three quarters. Third, the canvas was discovered fingerprints found in other works of the artist. And finally, according to scientists, at that time the only da Vinci could portray a person with such a stunning anatomical accuracy and detail. Just look at the hand Gallerani and see how carefully spelled out every nail and every wrinkle on the knuckles of her fingers.Both studies confirmed that the background of the canvas was painted over a dark not by da Vinci, around the figure of Cecilia was discovered particles of grayish-blue paint under a layer of black. Polish scientists have also found that originally in the background was a depiction of the window or some other source of natural light. It is still unknown when and by whom it was painted over the background of the painting (according to some, this had a hand Eugene Delacroix) because over the years of its existence it has repeatedly renewed and restored. But some features overlapping layers of paint suggest that the black background appeared between 1830 and 1870. Definitely a beautiful picture has become a bit like a flat poster, in contrast to other works of Leonardo, famous, among other things, stunning detail of the landscape in the background.On the basis of wood found traces of so-called \"cardboard\" picture from which the image was transferred to wood through tiny holes and coal dust. The tree was covered with a thin layer of primer (gesso), the underpainting was done with brown paint. In addition, the researchers determined that after finishing work on the painting the tree is not cut, evidenced by a narrow unpainted strip on all four sides.Was there a weasel?\nNumerous studies of the painting \"Lady with an ermine\" showed that da Vinci himself has rewritten it at least three times. In the first version of the film no ermine at the hands of Cecilia was not (here was not the blue capes on the girls shoulder, she was wearing only a red dress). In the next layer, the artist has added small animal, but he was smaller and gray. And here the question arises whether it is a stoat, and not, for example, Freda – home a ferret (they are predominantly painted in different shades of grey, and ermine in summer are reddish-brown fur). In the end, the hands Gallerani took the animal is white, and the picture began to appear everywhere as the \"Lady with an ermine\", even when the name of the heroine of the paintings was still for the researchers in question.Although scientists still agreed on the identity of the woman depicted in this portrait, the species of animal continues to be questioned. The reddish tint of his eyes again, allows you to suspect that it is ferret-albino. The fact that in the middle Ages and the Early Renaissance ferrets were domesticated for hunting wild rabbits, and in some places rats and mice. Stoats are amenable to domestication worse, besides, their fate at that time were often much more sad: the snow-white winter skins of animals were used to decorate the robes of the nobles.There is another, much less pleasant version: an animal that keeps Cecilia, is actually a \"flea fur\" stuffed ermine, which was used for catching pesky insects. Such accessories became fashionable in the late middle Ages and ranged from fur to fabulously expensive wool blankets stuffed with gold-plated legs and heads. However, a vegetarian and an animal lover da Vinci it would be unlikely to depict this example of taxidermy art.The secret life of Cecilia\nSeveral centuries, \"Lady with an ermine\" shrouded in mystery. Approximately 1491 painting left the Studio da Vinci and for several years kept Gallerani. In the spring of 1498, Isabella d'este asks Cecilia to send her the work of da Vinci: \"Remembering that Leonardo painted a portrait of you, we ask You to be so kind and send us Your picture with that courier\". Gallerani, though admitted in a response letter that has changed a lot since then, still are unable to deny the petitioner a senior. You can imagine how disastrous it turned out to be a journey for the film, because of its safety, hardly anyone cared. According to researchers from Washington, journey approximately 150 kilometers da Vinci's masterpiece, in all probability, have committed to being wrapped in cloth and leather and strapped to the saddle bags. Presumably, a month later the painting was returned to the owner, but his trail ends in three centuries.It is difficult to imagine what was the fate of the famous portrait, and how many movements and \"fix\" it survived until, when in 1800 it was purchased in Italy by the Polish Prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski. In all likelihood, soon after his arrival in Poland, the picture is once again restored. Then in the upper left corner reads \"LA BELE FERONIERE. LEONARD DAWINCI\" (Czartoryski believed that the portrait depicts the same woman in the picture \"Beautiful Ferronera\" although some researchers believe that this is actually Lucrezia Crivelli). During the nineteenth century \"Lady with an ermine\" repeatedly moved through Europe: Princess Czartoryski had to save the picture to the invading Russian army in 1830, it was then sent to Dresden and then to Paris, in the famous mansion \"Hotel Lambert\", where they lived Czartoryski. In Krakow Cecilia Gallerani returned in 1882, but it misadventures have not ended. Almost immediately after the occupation of Poland by the Germans in 1939, the work fell into the hands of the Nazis and was transferred to Berlin. A year later, the owner of \"Lady with an ermine\" was the Governor General of Poland, Hans Frank. At the end of the Second world war the painting was discovered in his abandoned summer residence of Bavaria and returned to Poland. Now the painting \"Lady with an ermine\" is in Krakow the Czartoryski Museum.Author: Eugene Sidelnikov"},{"paintingTitle":"The Annunciation","artistName":"Leonardo da Vinci","artistContentId":225091,"paintingContentId":"30277033-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1475, 98×217 cm • Oil, Wood","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy800/work/cb5/494162.jpg","paintingDescription":"Leonardo da Vinci for centuries with regularity, become the subject of disputes of scientists from different fields, art critics and art historians. In the case of pictorial works of the artist often was called into question their authorship: since Leonardo's own works were not signed, it is possible to focus only on his personal diaries with sketches and testimonies of contemporaries. About da Vinci's paintings \"The Annunciation\" researchers have not come to a consensus: some argue that job was written by Leonardo from first to last stroke, while others believe that the artist was a co-author. After numerous studies was discovered the details that can confirm both the first and second version.Who could be a co-author of the \"Annunciation\"?\nWork was only discovered in 1867 in the monastery of San Bartolomeo a Monteoliveto and transferred to the Uffizi Gallery. At that time, its author was considered Domenico Ghirlandaiobut two years later, the painting was attributed to Leonardo by the study of the diaries of the artist and the comparison of parts of the \"Annunciation\" with the sketches.In favor of the version that the painting was painted by da Vinci alone, according to carefully spelled out, shrouded in the haze the scenery in the background and traditional artist's anatomical accuracy. For example, the wings of Gabriel Leonardo copied from a real bird's wings, he wrote in one of his diaries. However, a certain unidentified \"Retoucher\", apparently, found these wings is not enough impressive for the messenger of God and quite rude lengthened them. You should pay attention to the faces of the characters in the movie. The face of the Archangel Gabriel like the angel, which da Vinci wrote in the corner \"Baptism Of Christ\"- the work of his teacher Verokkoand the virgin Mary – the famous \"The Madonna of the carnation\"written by da Vinci several years later.However, some researchers are of the opinion that \"Annunciation\" was painted by Leonardo together with his teacher. They believe that, as in the case of \"Baptism of Christ\", a large part of the painting was created by Andrea del Verokko, and the young disciple of the master asked to write the landscape in the background and the figure of the Archangel. One of the radiographic studies showed that part of the work allegedly performed Verokko, was written rather large, heavy brushstrokes, and the paint used contained lead. As for the angel and the landscape, the layers of paint thinner, brush strokes are very light, made with paints without lead content. The folds of Mary's clothes look traditionally Verokko heavy and immobile, as if carved from stone. One of the arguments of the supporters of the theory of collaboration is a sarcophagus standing between Mary and Archangel. This is a copy of the sarcophagus of Piero de ' Medici in the Church of San Lorenzo, made by Andrea Verokko. However, it is possible that the sarcophagus has portrayed Leonardo himself, as a tribute to the teacher.There is another version \"Annunciation\"written a few years later and stored in the Louvre, which is currently considered to be the work of Leonardo. However, this picture is much more controversial. Many researchers tend to believe its author Lorenzo di credi. Preserved documentary evidence that this small panel with a biblical scene was part of the altar of the Cathedral of Pistoia. Most of the work performed Verokko, and \"the Annunciation,\" he instructed di credi, one of his pupils. Leonardo repeatedly attributed to Dee's credit, and Vice versa, because they studied and worked Verokko at one time. Anyway, now the author of the Louvre \"Annunciation\" is recognized as da Vinci.The Annunciation painting\nIconographic and pictorial traditions of image of the Annunciation formed almost from the very beginning of Christianity. One of the first works depicting the famous biblical scene, is considered fresco from the Roman catacombs of PriscillaIII century. For the most part, the canons and the rules here have evolved over many centuries before the advent of Leonardo da Vinci to light. At the time of writing of the \"Annunciation\" artist was only about 20 years old, he has not yet become famous as an experimenter and innovator, and that it went against tradition.Around the V century formed the Canon, according to which Mary was depicted in the right part of the picture, and the Archangel Gabriel on the left. The details depend for the most part the text description of the scene of the Annunciation took for the basis of a particular artist. For example, in Luke the meeting of Mary with the angel that brought the Good news, is described quite briefly and sparingly. While there are many apocryphal texts which this scene is painted with much more detail. Many painters in their works was based on the Protevangelium of James, written in the mid second century, according to which Gabriel came to Mary twice: first at the source (or well) water, and then, in that moment, when she spun the threads for the purple veil of the temple in Jerusalem. Therefore, in many paintings the virgin is shown next to the source or the spindle in hand. According to other Apocrypha, in the time of the appearance of the Archangel Mary was reading the book of Isaiah, which predicted the coming of the Messiah. So artists, including da Vinci often wrote her with the bookin the hands or on the stand.Usually, Mary was depicted not in the open space. But often call surrounding her home difficult. These interiorsmore like a Palace or a temple, as seen from the Windows of the scenery rather like a fairy tale than real. With the onset of the Renaissance, painters began to add in his paintings more space and air, touched it and works depicting the Annunciation: the virgin and the Archangel Gabriel movedfrom the rooms to the balconies and open galleries.There are several details that distinguish most of the paintings on the theme of the Annunciation. Some of them, like spring at which Mary first meets Angela, transformirovalsyain the fountain or container of water. In many paintings Gabriel holds in his hands branch of white liliessymbolizing purity and chastity of Mary, sometimes the flowers are depicted in the center between the figures. In the case of da Vinci painting the Lily is a symbol of Florence. Some works of Lily replaces olive branch.View\nFor a long time most scholars and art critics believed that some of the details of the \"Annunciation\" given the inexperience to Leonardo who made this painting around the age of 20 years. It is believed that at that time da Vinci was working with composition and perspective, so I made some noticeable mistakes. For example, the right hand of the virgin Mary looks unnaturally long, and it is depicted so that it appears closer to the viewer than the whole figure of a woman. The wall to the right of the virgin is too long and the lamp, standing on the sarcophagus is too far away.However, one recent study showed that all of these \"flaws\" magically corrected, it is only the viewer to stand in the right spot relative to the picture. Scientists have suggested that while working on \"the Annunciation\", the artist knew that the potential audience will not stand directly in front of the picture, and will look to her right and a little below. Probably in the place where he planned to hang the work, she held a place in which to look at it was only possible from this position.Now, if in the Uffizi Gallery, to stand to the right of the picture, wall it flattens out and becomes proportional to, and the lamp is moved closer to Mary. Her right arm is shortened to natural sizes and adopts the correct position relative to the viewer. In addition, if you look from the right point, the figure of the virgin Mary increases and becomes the center of the plot. Thus, the work of Leonardo is a not immature firstborn of a young artist, but a careful result of his optical researches and experiments.

A fresco which is not really a fresco. A three-year-long experiment. A fertile field for speculation about the meaning of the symbols and the true personalities of the depicted characters. An inescapable challenge for restorers. All this is about one of the most famous works of art in the world.\r\nThe First Step Is Always the Hardest: Who Commissioned Leonardo to Paint The Last Supper\r\nIn 1494, the odious and ambitious Ludovico Sforza became the Duke of Milan. Despite all the ambitions and weaknesses, to some extend inherent, I must say, in almost every prominent statesman, Ludovico served a great deal for the benefit of his estate and achieved a significant diplomatic success by establishing peaceful relations with Florence, Venice and Rome.He paid a lot of attention to the development of agriculture, industry, science and culture. Among the painters he especially favoured was Leonardo da Vinci. The artist created the portrait of Ludovico’s mistress and the mother of his son Cecilia Gallerani; the picture is better known as The Lady with an Ermine. Presumably, the painter also immortalized the Duke’s legitimate wife Beatrice d'Este, as well as his second mistress and the mother of his another illegitimate son Lucrezia Crivelli.Ludovico’s house chapel was that at the Dominican monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie, whose abbot was a close friend of the Duke. The ruler of Milan sponsored a major reconstruction of the church, which he saw as a future mausoleum and a monument to the Sforza dynasty. His vain plans were exacerbated by the sudden death of his wife Beatrice and daughter Bianca in 1497, two years after Leonardo began working on The Last Supper.In 1495 the artist was commissioned to paint one of the walls of the chapel’s dining hall with a nine-meter fresco depicting a popular Gospel story about the last meeting of Christ with the apostles, at which he showed his disciples the sacrament of the Eucharist for the first time. Back then, no one even suspected what a long and difficult fate was waiting for the fresco.\r\nExperimental Art of Leonardo da Vinci\r\nUntil then, Leonardo had never worked work with frescoes. But how could that be an obstacle for a person who, of all methods of cognition, chose the empirical one and didn’t take anyone on their word, preferring to know everything by his own experience? He acted on the principle of “not taking easy ways”, and in this case remained faithful to it till the end.Instead of using the good old technique of applying tempera to fresh plaster (which, in fact, gave the name to the fresco, originating from the Italian fresco – \"fresh\"), Leonardo began to experiment. Literally all the factors and stages, involved in the creating frescos, consistently became the subject of his experiment: starting with the construction of scaffolding, for which he tried to invent his own mechanisms, and ending with the composition of plaster and paints.Firstly, he categorically did not like the method of working on wet plaster, since the latter set rather quickly and did not allow working thoughtfully on each fragment and endlessly refining it, leading to perfection – the way Leonardo used to create his paintings. Secondly, the traditional egg tempera did not give him the necessary degree of brightness of colours, since it was somewhat dimmed and changed colour when dried. Mixing pigments with oil made it possible to get more expressive and shiny colours. Besides, it was possible to achieve a different density of shades: from very thick and opaque to subtle and luminous. It perfectly agreed with his love for his signature sfumato technique and creating the filigree light and shade effects.Still, that's not all. In order to make the oil emulsion more adapted to the requirements of wall painting, the artist decided to add egg yolk to it, thus obtaining a hitherto unprecedented composition of \"oil tempera\". As time would show, in the long term this bold experiment did not justify itself.Business Before Pleasure: Long History of Creation of The Last SupperAccording to contemporaries, Leonardo approached all aspects of the creation of this painting with such thoroughness that it lasted indefinitely, and this immensely irritated the Abbot of the monastery. First, who would like their dining hall to be in a state of \"chronic repair\" with all its attendant nuances (some sources mention a very unpleasant smell of Leonardo’s composition of the plaster)?Secondly, the long process also meant a corresponding increase in the financial costs of the fresco, and the more so that the whole team was working on it. The amount of preparatory works such as the application of plaster, primer and coating of lead white was supposed to involve all members of Leonardo’s studio.The Abbot's patience was gradually coming to an end, and he complained to the Duke about the artist’s slowness and laziness. According to the legend, given by Vasari in The Lives, Leonardo, in his defense, answered Ludovico that he could not find a suitable scoundrel for the role of a model for Judas. And that if the face of the required degree of disgust would not be found, he \"could always use the head of the Abbot, so annoying and immodest.\"There is another legend about the model for Judas. It is so beautiful that even if the situation was far from reality, it would be worth inventing it. The artist allegedly looked for his Judas among the dregs of society, and in the end chose the worst drunkard from the gutter. \"The model\" could hardly stand on his feet and did not understand much, but when the image of Judas was finished, the drunkard stared at the painting and said that he had already posed for it before.It turned out that three years before these events, when he was a young and chaste chorister in the church choir, he was noticed by some painter and offered the role of a model for the image of Christ.It turns out that one and the same man in different periods of his life happened to be an embodiment of absolute purity and love, as well as the prototype of the greatest fall and betrayal. It’s a beautiful parable about the fragile boundaries between the good and the evil and how hard it is to climb up and easy to roll down.\r\nElusive Beauty: How Much Leonardo Remained in The Last Supper?\r\nDespite all the efforts and experiments with the composition of paint, Leonardo still failed to make a revolution in creating frescoes. They were usually supposed to delight the eye for many centuries, but the destruction of the paint layer of The Last Supper began during the painter’s life. Already in the middle of the XVI century Vasari mentioned that \"nothing was visible except a muddle of blots\".Numerous restorations and attempts to save the fresco by the legendary Italian only aggravated the losses. In the 30s of the last century the British art historian Kenneth Clark studied preparatory sketches and early copies of the painting made by the artists who took part in the fresco’s creation. He compared them to what was left of the fresco, and his conclusions were disappointing: \"The exaggerated grimacing types, with their flavour of Michelangelo's 'Last Judgement', suggest that the leading hand was that of a feeble mannerist of the sixteenth century.\"The last and most extensive restoration was completed in 1999. It took about two decades and required an investment of more than 20 billion lire. It is no wonder: restorers had to do an extremely delicate work: it was necessary to remove all layers of early restorations and not to damage little pieces which remained from the original fresco. The head of the restoration works recalled that the fresco was treated “as if it were a real disabled person”.Despite the critics’ claims that as a result of those restorations the painting lost its \"spirit of the original\", today it is still closer to what the monks of the monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie saw in front of them during the meal. The main paradox is that one of the most famous and recognizable works of art in the world contains only no more than 20 percent of the original.In fact, now it is the embodiment of a collective interpretation of Leonardo's plan, obtained through painstaking research and analysis of all available information. Still, as it often happens in the art world, the difficult fate of the exhibit only adds to its’ points and value (just think of the story of the abduction and acquisition of Leonardo’s Gioconda, which brought it to the absolute top of the mass culture).See also: What is actually depicted in The Last Supper by Leonardo da Vinci?Author: Natalia Azarenko"},{"paintingTitle":"The Virgin of the Rocks (Madonna of the Rocks)","artistName":"Leonardo da Vinci","artistContentId":225091,"paintingContentId":"30277035-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1486, 199×122 cm • Oil, Canvas, Wood","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1200/work/1e8/378913.jpg","paintingDescription":"Probably, every painting by Leonardo da Vinci is invested with an air of mystery and enigmas. The altar image The Virgin of the Rocks is not an exception. Why are there two versions of it, one of which is located in the Louvre, Paris, and the second one is in the London National Gallery? Why is one of them painted almost a quarter-century after the other one? Read the description of the picture The Virgin of the Rocks by Da Vinci to know these and then some.Who ordered the Virgin?In the early twentieth century, a contract signed on April 25, 1483 was discovered in Italian archives. According to the contract, one party represented by Leonardo da Vinci and two more artists, brothers Ambrogio and Evangelista de Predis, undertook to fulfil an order for painting an altarpiece for the church of San Francesco Grande, the second largest religious structure in Milan after the cathedral. They had specified a certain deadline for this work: December 4, eight months later, the day of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, according to the Gregorian calendar of the Catholic liturgical year. The second party were members of the Brotherhood of the Immaculate Conception, which included representatives of the most respected families of the city. They undertook to pay 800 lire to the artists for the work done.However, in the end something went wrong, as it often happened to Leonardo. The result was not confined to the terms set out in the contract. Thus, customers expected to see the Madonna with Jesus surrounded by angels and two prophets in the central panel, and four angels with musical instruments on the side panels, who were singing laudatory hymns.As you can see, the client’s only wish that was satisfied were the Madonna and the baby. Instead of a host of angels and prophets, he painted another baby – John the Baptist, plus Archangel Uriel. Even the side panels, which are believed to be made by Ambrogio de Predis, do not comply with the prescriptions: only one angel instead of four is playing music on each side 1, 2). Needless to say, Da Vinci missed the stipulated deadline, as usual, for a couple of years.Why did Leonardo fail to complete the Virgin of the Rocks within the contract deadline?Some scholars suggest that the artist just decided to continue working on an already started picture, because he believed it would perfectly satisfy the conditions stipulated by the brotherhood. The artist might also hope that the customer would never reject the masterpiece upon seeing it, even if the disagreement might occur.However, he did not take into account that the altarpiece is not just a picture to impress the imagination with its artfulness and beauty. The altar must perform very specific functions and reflect the dogmas of the church community that ordered it.Eventually, Leonardo even had to seek help from his influential patron the Milanese Duke Ludovico Sforza, in order to collect the royalties from the clients. It is noteworthy that despite the lawsuit with the brotherhood, the plot and characters of the second picture, which nevertheless took its proper place in the altar of the church of San Francesco Grande in the early 16th century, was almost identical (now this version is in London).The differences are in nuances: apparently, having made concessions, Leonardo made the faces of the Madonna, the babies and the archangel beatific, as if filled with moonlight, and drew the halos. At the London version, the Virgin looks detached, faces of both babies are unusually adult, and the mysterious pointing finger of the archangel Uriel disappeared.Probably, the brethren considered the colder, more serious and less earthly The Virgin of the Rocks more compliant with their ideas of about the altarpiece. Probably, they believed it had more power to inspire people to pray. The Louvre version, warm, tender and pastorally charming, dropped off the radar until 1625. Its location and fate was completely unknown until the moment the picture glowed in the royal collection in France.The botanical symbols in The Virgin of the Rocks by Da VinciThe painter was interested in almost all spheres of science and nature. He investigated human and animal anatomy, geology, forms of vegetation. All this knowledge added to the artistry and realism of his works, consequently you can easily identify the plants he painted around the characters of the picture.In the tradition of religious painting, different colours often had certain meaning, so they rarely appeared in pictures in a random way. Believers were well acquainted with the dictionary of plant symbols, and it was not hard for the enlightened to read them. Thus, to the right of the Virgin’s head is the columbine, whose popular name suggests “the dove of the Holy Ghost”. “Just above her right hand is a species of galium known in English as Our Lady’s Bedstraw and traditionally associated with the manger”, said historian Charles Nicholl. “Below the foot of the infant Christ are cyclamen, whose heart-shaped leaves make it an emblem of love and devotion, and by his knee is a basal rosette of primrose, an emblem of virtue (as in Verocchio’s sculpture of the Woman with a Bunch of Flowers). Another familiar plant, seen below the kneeling St. John, is the acanthus (Acanthus mollis), traditionally planted over graves, and considered a symbol of the resurrection because of its rapid growth of brilliant glossy green leaves in spring. Also in the painting, in the cornices of the rock, is the hypericum, or St. John’s wort, its small dots of red on yellow petals representing the blood of the martyred St. John.”As for topographical nuances, such as rocks and the grotto in the background, their perfection was noted by a geologist and Renaissance art historian Ann Pizzorusso, who studied the painting in 1996. She said in her verdict about the skill of Da Vinci that this painting is the geological masterpiece, in which Leonardo reproduces complex geographic formations with particular accuracy.Why is Archangel Uriel next to the Virgin but not Joseph?The plot of the picture is based on the life story of John the Baptist, compiled in the 15th century by friar Domenico Cavalca. It tells that during the meeting of the infants John and Christ in the desert, the latter was under the auspices of Archangel Uriel.Concerning Joseph, Charles Nicholl in his book Leonardo da Vinci: Flights of the Mind notes that absence of Joseph, the husband of Mary, does not look accidental, since the painter excludes Joseph from all his paintings involving the Holy Family. For example, on different versions of The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne Leonardo replaces Joseph with Jesus’s grandmother, mother of Mary. The author said that the deep psychological underpinnings of this approach is clearly seen even if you are not a Freudian. It probably implies the special status of Leonardo in the family of his father Ser Piero, who participated in his life, although he did not recognize the illegitimate son as his heir.Another researcher of Da Vinci’s life and work, writer Ross King draws attention to the femininity of the appearance of Archangel Uriel. He believes that the model for his painting was “almost certainly a woman”. At the same time, he does not jump to conclusions about the model for Madonna. King said that the question of the model’s gender became even more confusing after they had discovered a previously unknown painting under a layer of paint in the other work by Leonardo, the London version of Virgin of the Rocks. It was a portrait of the Virgin Mary, and her features are exactly the same as those of St. Philip from The Last Supper. It is reasonable to conclude that Leonardo used the same sketch and the same model for both images of Mary and the apostle. Although, we still do not know, whether the model was a man or woman. \nAuthor: Natalia Azarenko"},{"paintingTitle":"Leda","artistName":"Leonardo da Vinci","artistContentId":225091,"paintingContentId":"30277036-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1500-th\n • Oil, Wood","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1000/work/860/77673.jpg","paintingDescription":"There is still no description of this artwork.

Upon seeing it in the Louvre, surrounded by tourists (unless you’re wise enough to get there early before the crowds come bustling in), the painting is smaller than expected, and the average visitor spends 15 seconds observing it. They take more time setting up their phones to take a selfie. She was the first rock star of the fine-art world, and for many she is the sole reason they come to the Louvre, standing in line with people from around the world just so they can say that they’ve seen it. And many of them, because they don’t get a chance to really study and appreciate it in peace, leave unimpressed. According to Giorgio Vasari, who wrote the first account of the Mona Lisa, the model was Lisa del Giocondo, wife of Florentine silk merchant Francesco del Giocondo, and da Vinci hired musicians and jesters to keep her amused and make her smile. She died July 15, 1542, and church records show that she had an elaborate funeral procession, although attempts to determine the exact model by DNA testing bone fragments from a church graveyard in Florence have proved to be inconclusive.Walter Pater, a writer from the Victorian Era, wrote the following passage about the masterpiece:“We all know the face and hands of the figure, set in its marble chair, in that circle of fantastic rocks, as in some faint light under sea. Perhaps of all ancient pictures time has chilled it least. The presence that thus rose so strangely beside the waters, is expressive of what in the ways of a thousand years men had come to desire. Hers is the head upon which all \"the ends of the world are come,\" and the eyelids are a little weary. It is a beauty wrought out from within upon the flesh, the deposit, little cell by cell, of strange thoughts and fantastic reveries and exquisite passions. Set it for a moment beside one of those white Greek goddesses or beautiful women of antiquity, and how would they be troubled by this beauty, into which the soul with all its maladies has passed!”Even before her pop-culture fan cult started in the 20th century—fueled by the intrigue of her theft in 1911—her portrait revolutionized Western art. Before da Vinci painted her, portraits—especially of women—were mostly two-dimensional, often profiles, with flat colors and unnatural poses. Using the new medium of oil on wood, as well as sfumato (his signature technique of blending shades to create realistic, soft outlines), he was able to create a three-dimensional effect, inspiring copies by contemporaries, including Raphael, who went on to use his techniques in their own works. There are many versions of her, painted at around the time Leonardo lived, and art historians and scientists work to understand whether or not they were also painted—completely or partially—by da Vinci. The Isleworth Mona Lisa, for instance, show the same woman with a mysterious smile (looking slightly younger), only she is sitting in between two columns, and the otherworldly landscape in the background is far less detailed, leading to speculation that it was painted by a different artist. The Prado Mona Lisa in Madrid, being far less damaged than the Louvre version, indicates what da Vinci’s masterpiece might have looked like when it was new. Its background had been painted over black, but, once it had been restored, the colors are brighter and it has been determined that it was painted, probably by a pupil (likely either Salai or Francesco Melzi), alongside da Vinci as he worked on his most famous version. An anonymous Russian art collector bought a version held in St. Petersburg that, although magnificently painted, was determined by the chemicals in the paints to have been done later, and in France. The primer layer revealed that the ground was red, while da Vinci, like most Renaissance artists, used a white ground. The presence of barium sulfate indicates that this version was painted in France between 1620 and 1680, long after the master’s death. There have been several nude versions, including a charcoal drawing the same size and completed around the same time that has made many speculate that it was also Leonardo’s work, and perhaps a rough drawing that his final version was based on. If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, no one in the history of the world has been flattered more sincerely that Leonardo da Vinci. Starting with Eugène Bataille’s La Joconde fumant la pipe, Le Rire, in 1887, in which Mona Lisa is smoking a long pipe and blowing smoke rings. With the ease of making reproductions in the 20th century, new generations of artists, beginning in 1919 with Marcel Duchamp’s L.H.O.O.Q., (which, when pronounced in French, sounds like “Elle a chaud au cul,” or “She’s got a hot ass”) began putting their own twists on the famous painting, taunting the French bourgeoisie and their cult of the Mona Lisa. While Salvador Dalí considered Duchamp’s reproduction to be an attack on traditional female beauty and a “desecration,” that didn’t stop him from collaborating with Phillipe Halsman to create the Dalí Mona Lisa photomontage in 1954, in which his face and trademark mustache replace hers and he is holding a handful of large coins. When the French government sent the original Mona Lisa to the United States in 1963, the celebrity status of the painting inspired Andy Warhol, who had been fascinated with American stars like Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe, to give her the same treatment. Thirty Are Better Than One was his most famous replication, in which he finds in Mona Lisa the ideal celebrity: mysterious and famous for simply being glamorous. The enigmatic British graffiti artist Banksy has created several works parodying her, including the bold act of stealthily hanging a smiley-faced portrait in the Louvre itself, as well as decorating walls with stencils of her holding a bazooka and the striking Mona Lisa Shows Her Bum (Elle a chaud au cul, indeed). In 1959, Columbian artist Ferdinand Botero imagined an adorable, younger Lisa del Giocondo with his Mona Lisa at the Age of Twelve Years, and in 1978 he revisited her, reproducing da Vinci’s original in his signature “chubby” style and adding pyramidal mountains and even a volcano in the background.French scientist Pascal Cotte, using multispectral scanning analysis, discovered that at least three earlier portraits had been started underneath the final Mona Lisa: a study of a head, a Madonna portrait, and what he believes to be the actual Lisa Gherardini. The final painting known and loved worldwide, Cotte believes, is a different woman entirely. Several pearl-tipped hairpins that had been painted over can be seen even with the naked eye, if you know where to look for them. Using the technology he invented, he was able to reconstruct the way da Vinci painted Mona Lisa, and also claimed to solve the mystery of her lack of eyebrows and eyelashes. He claims that there is evidence that da Vinci had painted them, but they had faded and disappeared over time and during restorations. Before starting the Mona Lisa, da Vinci drew many studies of different parts of the body in different positions, including the sketch of a mouth with a strikingly similar enigmatic smile. A comparison with an earlier painting of his, La Bella Principessa, the profile portrait of 13-year-old Bianca Sforza before her marriage, indicates that da Vinci had somehow unlocked the key to drawing the ideal, psychologically pleasing smile. Da Vinci was said to have taken the Mona Lisa everywhere he traveled, in the end never giving it to Francesco del Giocondo, who had ordered the painting of his wife. It was taken from the Louvre during the Franco–Prussian War and spent the entire war on the run, and had been in the possession of the powerful French kings and hung in Napoleon Bonaparte’s bedroom. Mona Lisa herself seems to bring out the best and worst in people, not only inspiring songs, books and movies, but also numerous bizarre vandalism attempts: rocks, coffee cups, and burning acid have all been thrown at her and she has been sprayed with paint and called “overrated” and “ugly”; such is the price of fame for the art world’s most celebrated woman. Iranian–Canadian artist Amir Baradaran, building on the Italian Futurist and Dada movements and seeking “to explore the experiential, conceptual and legal shifts suggested by the advent of AR ” brought Duchamp’s mischievous attitude—mixed with a healthy modern criticism of concepts of nationalism and identity—into the 21st century. He used a smartphone app to reproduce the painting and manipulate Giocondo into letting her hair down and applying a headscarf made from the French flag. Perhaps the most traumatizing experience for Mona Lisa was her abovementioned theft. Vincenzo Peruggia, an Italian man working at the Louvre (ironically, his job was to build protective glass cases for paintings, including the Mona Lisa), decided to stay overnight at the museum; wrap the painting in his smock; and hide it in his apartment in Paris for two years before taking it back to Italy, where he imagined he would be welcomed as a national hero. It took twenty-four hours for anyone to notice the painting was missing, but when it was, her previously little-known face was plastered on the front page of newspapers all over the world, turning her into an overnight sensation. Lines started forming at the Louvre to see the empty space where she had hung before the theft. The borders of France were closed, and for two years they searched for her, trying to make up for the national embarrassment of losing such a masterpiece. Pablo Picasso, who was found to be in possession of other artwork stolen from the Louvre—two small Iberian statues—and who ran with a crowd called the Wild Men of Paris, became a suspect but was exonerated by the court. In December 1913, Peruggia was caught after trying to sell the Mona Lisa to a gallery director in Florence, who took it for “safekeeping” and promptly called the police. The thief was arrested in his hotel room and sentenced to one year and fifteen days (serving only six months) and Mona Lisa got to visit her birthplace, being exhibited all over Italy, before being returned to the Louvre."},{"paintingTitle":"The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne","artistName":"Leonardo da Vinci","artistContentId":225091,"paintingContentId":"30277039-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1510, 168×112 cm • Oil, Wood\n • \n\nAlternative titlesMadonna with child and St. Anna\n\n","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1200/work/415/515759.jpg","paintingDescription":"There is still no description of this artwork.

Dali was born in a quasi-surreal existence. His brother, also named Salvador, died as a toddler, nine months before Dali’s birth. His parents told him he was the reincarnation of his older brother, which he also came to believe. As a child, Dali attended drawing school, and by the age of thirteen, Dali’s father was arranging exhibitions of his charcoal drawings. In 1922, Dali went to study at the School of Fine Arts in San Fernando, where he was known as a bit of a dandy, wearing long hair and sideburns, and stockings with knee breeches in the style of 19th century aesthetes. \r\n\r\nDuring his stay at the academy, Dali tried his hand in cubism and dada. But his stay was short lived, after he was expelled a few weeks before final exams, for stating that no one in the school was qualified enough to examine him. After his expulsion, he traveled to Paris, where he met Pablo Picasso and Joan Miro, who heavily influenced his painting styles. Dali continually borrowed from many painting styles. From impressionism to renaissance works, he combined all elements into single compositions, raising interesting critiques from art critics, who were unsure as how to received his works. Always a dandy, Dali grew a large moustache, which was a trademark of his appearance for the rest of his life. \r\n\r\nIn 1929, Dali began a relationship with the woman who would later become his wife, Gala. His father disapproved, and saw his connection with surrealism as a demoralizing influence on his son. Upon hearing reports that Dali had created a work with an inscription insulting his mother, who had died eight years earlier of breast cancer, the elder Dali disowned and disinherited his son, telling him never to return home. Dali then married Gala and moved into a house at Port Lligat. \r\n\r\nDali spent the middle and late years of his life between the United States and his beloved Catalonia, Spain, collaborating with other artists, canoodling with social elites, and creating many stories for the newspapers. After his wife’s death in 1982, Dali lost much of his will to live, and purposely dehydrated himself almost to the point of death. There was also a mysterious fire in his apartment in 1984, from which he was saved, but many thought was a suicide attempt. He died of heart failure five years later at the age of 84.

Dalí can be called the most prominent surrealist, whose paintings cannot be confused with the works of other artists. His paintings correspond exactly to the main characteristic of the direction: the reality and images from the dreams are closely interweaved in one plot.Works by Dalí can be either admired or rejected, but they can't be taken with indifference, as they allow to take a fascinating journey to the corners of the artist's inner world. He encoded his unconsciousness, Freud's psychoanalysis, childhood trauma and adult complexes in his works. One of the most famous paintings by Salvador Dalí, and probably the most personal, judging by its size and images imprinted on the canvas, is The Persistence of Memory. The art critics of all times has always been discussed about what is depicted on it. Since the artist did not often explain the meaning of his works, there is enough space for thoughts while analysing The Persistence of Memory, but some of the imageries are quite common for Dalí. Here he portrayed himself and the olive tree, and ants, and egg, and many other symbolic things that wander from work to work.\r\nCreation history of The persistence of memory by Salvador Dalí\r\nBefore talking about the meaning of a particular work, it would be interesting to find out under what circumstances it was painted and what contributed to the emergence of certain images. The process of creating an artwork is always interesting for both researchers of the artist and the public, since this information gives the opportunity to learn more about the artist, his personal life and environment. The Persistence of Memory by Salvador Dalí, the main images of which are clocks, was painted in 1931. The picture itself is surprisingly small, this shows the personal nature of the artwork. The artist loved this painting, and his wife, Gala, said that “once a person sees it, they will never forget it.”The Soft Watches (an alternative title of the work) was painted in a couple of hours, while the artist's wife was in the cinema with her friends. Referring to a terrible headache, he remained at home. It is considered, and the artist admitted himself, that the image of the soft clocks was inspired by the thoughts about a Camembert cheese with which spouses finished their dinner. Changeable shape and flexibility of cheese contributed to the emergence of strange associations in the artist’s mind, that he immediately reproduced on a canvas. The other started work, The view of Cap de Creus, served as a basis for The Persistence of Memory, every detail is important to analyse it. This cape is depicted on many of the artist’s works. He considered the Catalonia coast, located near his native town Figueres, a place which is an embodiment of the creation theory of all his strange paranoid symbols and metamorphosis. Evidently, the firmness of the principles of this theory the painter associated with granite rocks. Despite the view of the cape, there was a withered olive in the picture – the dead truncated branch. According to the artist, after dinner, he decided to look at the canvas before going to bed.A depicted landscape seemed to him just a basis for a deeper plot; the picture obviously needed some idea. Tormented by a headache, he was going to sleep, but suddenly an image of the watch melting down from the branch of olive, inspired by the thoughts about the nature of melting cheese, occurred to him. Despite the poor state of health, the brilliant painter took his brush and finished one of his most famous works that same evening.\r\nAnalysis of the painting The Persistence of Time\r\nMany researchers associate the idea of creating this work of art with the popularity of Einstein's relativity theory. However, Dalí himself claimed that, regarding the creation of The Soft Watches, he relied more on the statement of Heraclitus – \"Everything flows, everything changes\". The artist questioned the very nature of time: its linearity seemed unobvious to the painter, and the complex nature of this phenomenon was emphasized by the variety of images on the canvas.I’d like to start describing the The Persistence of Memory by exploring the characters that are present here in large numbers. First of all, they are, of course, clocks. Soft, shapeless, hanging from a tree and flowing down a hard surface, it symbolizes the relativity of the concept of time, its ability to flow in different directions, returning to the past and transferring to the future.The head, located in the center of the picture, is also in the power of these processes. It is a self-portrait of the artist and is present in many of his works. Given that he created this painting during a migraine attack, it can be assumed that the image of the sleeper himself is conceived as a desire to avoid suffering and escape from the strange images that arise during heavy sleep.Time in its usual sense is depicted in the painting in the form of a solid clock which is being devoured by ants – for Dalí these insects served as a symbol of dust, decay and decomposition. Objective time, like a certain entity working against all living things, is denied by the artist: that is why it is subjected to destruction, and the clock is depicted dial-down.Dalí placed the egg, which is the symbol of life, on the seashore. According to the mystical ancient Greek teachings, the sky and the earth were formed from the two halves of the egg from which hatched the deity Phanes, so the location of the object in the picture was chosen not accidentally. The sea symbolizes eternal life, immortality. Thus, from the set of symbols emerges the meaning of the picture The Persistence of Memory – the relationship of what is happening in the past, present and future, the ambiguity of time, its value and meaningless at the same time. It is noteworthy that all the clocks on the canvas show different times. Perhaps they mark some important events, permanently imprinted in memory.Despite the rejection of linear time, Dalí does not repudiate it completely. A symbol, balancing the concepts of the objective and the subjective, the real world and the fictional one, inspired by dreams, is a mirror. In the painting it is depicted in the form of a solid tangible surface lying horizontally."},{"paintingTitle":"Dream inspired by the flight of a bee around a pomegranate a second before awakening","artistName":"Salvador Dali","artistContentId":220740,"paintingContentId":"308ac5e1-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1944, 51×40.5 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1200/work/2af/451958.jpg","paintingDescription":"The mysterious world of dreams has always attracted people of art. In attempts to transfer to canvas the fleeting vision of a phantasmagoric characters, the artists of different eras created whimsical paintings, sometimes like a children's cartoon, and sometimes frightening the viewer. Do not stay aside and the great Spaniard, Salvador Dalí, famous for his surrealist works. Our art site offers you to get acquainted with the description of a picture of Dali \"Sleep...\" (full title — \" Dream caused by the flight of a bee around a pomegranate a second before awakening\") related to the genre symbolic painting.\r\nDali, Freud and symbolism\r\nThe work of Salvador Dali \"Sleep...\" is based on the works of Austrian psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, in which he talks about the phenomenon of long meaningful dream. Freud described it as a dream, the plot of which is caused by any stimulus from the outside: the subconscious of a sleeping person identificeret this stimulus and turns it into images which have similarities with the source of the irritation. If the stimulus is a threat in reality, then in a dream he will make a threatening appearance that will provoke the awakening.On the canvas we see Dali dream caused by the flight of a bee — like are both an observer and a dreamer. In the lower part of the painting of a sleeping Nude woman, as if hovering above the stone slab, which is similar in form to some continent. The plate is surrounded by a space blue hue, which many researchers of creativity of the painter is interpreted as a symbol of the subconscious. We can assume that, before going to sleep, the woman was holding a grenade — now in her dream he is floating down, drawing his scent the bee-sweet tooth. A woman hears in a dream the hum of bees. The subconscious signals that the insect can be dangerous, and the brain reacts, causing the images of yellow and black (to match the colors of the insect) tigers. One animal jumps out of the mouth of another, and that in turn arises from the open mouth of the fish, emerges from a huge pomegranate that hung over sleeping. Sharp claws and teeth — a symbol of the fear of the sting of an insect, like a rifle, whose bayonet's thrust into the woman's hand. To protect yourself from injection, the sleeping must Wake up.Salvador Dali was often depicted in his paintings of whimsical elephants with long thin legs, and the painting \"dreams\" is no exception — this character fits here not only because of its unusual appearance. It is also called the elephant by Bernini — on behalf of the Italian sculptor of the seventeenth century, created the sculpture, which depicts an elephant with an Egyptian obelisk on his back. Art historians believe that Bernini actually got the idea from an old novel, which describes the various dreams of the main character. In one dream there is the image of an elephant through the obelisk. The elephant print on the picture Given is a reference like this novel and Freud's theory of dreams.Today Dali's painting \"Sleep...\", written by the brilliant surrealist in 1944, is preserved in the Museum Thyssen-Bornemisza (Madrid, Spain)."},{"paintingTitle":"Gradiva","artistName":"Salvador Dali","artistContentId":220740,"paintingContentId":"308ac5e2-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1931, 20.6×15.5 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1200/work/917/538601.jpg","paintingDescription":"There is still no description of this artwork.

Born to wealthy family, he began his schooling with a baccalaureate in literature in 1853. Due to the wishes of his father, who wanted him to go to law school, he enrolled at the University of Paris in 1853 to pursue a law degree, where he made little effort. Degas, who at age 18 had transformed one of the rooms is his house into a studio, and was a registered copyist at the Louvre by 1853, left law school after two years, and a year later traveled to Italy studying the art of the great masters. \r\n\r\nHis paintings were exhibited at the Paris Salon beginning in 1865, but they attracted little attention, and his subject matte slowly transitioned from history paintings to more contemporary subjects. In 1870, at the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, he enrolled as a member of the National Guard, but his eyesight, which was found defective during rifle training, was troublesome and so he could not serve. Three years later, in 1873, Degas’ father died, revealing a massive amount of business debt held by his brother, Rene. Degas was forced to sell the family home and many family paintings in order to cover the debt, and for the first time, had to rely on the income from his paintings for survival. It was in 1874 that he began producing his most successful works. \r\n\r\nAlthough he is considered one of the founders of Impressionism, and he indeed worked with impressionist artists, such as Edouard Manet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir, he rejected the label “Impressionist.” He detested the scandals brought about by their Impressionist Exhibitions, and he mocked them for painting outdoors. His personal life was outwardly uneventful, due to his belief that an artist should live private lives of solitude. He thus lived a life of solitude, and eventually broke with all of his Jewish friends, due to his anti-Semitic beliefs and argumentative nature. He never married, opposed social change and technological innovations, always painted indoors, and ceased painting by 1912, at which he time he was nearly blind. He died wandering the streets of Paris in 1917. \r\n ","story":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Degas","gender":"male","relatedArtistsIds":[],"popularPaintings":[{"paintingTitle":"Young woman with IBIS","artistName":"Edgar Degas","artistContentId":213253,"paintingContentId":"30f01760-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1862, 100×74.9 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1200/work/ecd/399582.jpg","paintingDescription":"There is still no description of this artwork.

The model's came here and spent hours doing their thing: standing, washed, dried, yawned, dressed and undressed. Surprised at first by the fact that Degas did not write, but simply observes they were continually surprised and gave the artist notice. This is something he wanted. At the Eighth impressionist exhibition, in 1886, when was the last time managed to collect in one room of artists, started when all this revolution, Edgar Degas invited seven pastels. They had long and deliberately prosaic name, almost clerical or catalogazione (so critics systematizing the legacy of the artist, called a packet of some minor sketches and preparatory drawings) – \"A series of naked women bathing, washable, dry, combed hair, or sitting at the toilet at the time, as their comb\".Edgar Degas is perhaps the first artist who has reconciled Nudes and modernity after centuries chaste slonovski tradition, prescribing to clothe the naked female body in floating draperies or surround the symbolic attributes of the ancient goddesses. Instead of acquittal Greek togas, floating cupids, clouds, sea foam and other divine entourage, which even twenty years before that, the artists covered the nakedness of their heroines, Degas gives them a washcloth and a comb. It's not provocative and shameless nudity \"Olympia\" Edouard Manet is the most natural, casual and boring environment in which a woman can be naked. Washable and hair Degas woman do not look the viewer in the eye. What's there not look – even their faces are often not visible. They awkwardly lift your leg, getting out of the bathroom, bend over unceremoniously and turned back to us and back to collect in a bun wet hair so carefully brushed, they wipe their feet and back. \"Until now, the Nude model was always depicted in poses suggesting the presence of an audience\"- explained the artist added that his task was to create the feeling of peeping through the keyhole.By the mid-1880s between the Impressionists, the founders of the movement remained more differences than evident points of contact. The exhibition, which was presented washable women Degas – the last joint. Artists are rebels grew up and, each in their own way rejecting the importance of fleeting impressions, looking for timeless images that focus my mind on something important and let the classical art itself to influence. Critics praised Degas in his quest – they say he's only an ardent admirer Ingres in the impressionistic camp, could in the bath a series of pastels to commit another act of reconciliation. Woman bathing Degas finally reconciled Ingres and Delacroix, reconciled line and color.

And if it could not be helped, he asked to say something very simple, like, ‘He loved painting.’ Well, it is nothing but the truth. If he was ever really concerned about anything, it was how to show gesture and motion accurately by means of drawing and painting. He would look for unusual angles, shift the point of sight, and the more challenging the task was, the more eagerly he took on it.Ballet, of course, was a real conundrum for the artist. It involved complex postures, lithe bodies, deep theatrical perspectives, bright lights, and opportunities to choose an angle at which no artist had ever painted people.Blue Dancers appeared at the time when the artist’s eyesight had grown very poor and he had to cover his eyes against sunlight. Six years later, he would cease painting completely and, instead, take up wax moulding by touch. But his subjects would remain dancers in complex postures and horses in motion.Girl dancers and choreography students would come to Degas’s studio. There, he would make dozens of studies to be later arranged together in a well-calculated, well-balanced composition. He loved the effect of a spontaneous snapshot that was actually a result of thorough preparation and calculation. He confessed, ‘What I do is the result of reflection and of the study of the great masters; of inspiration, spontaneity, temperament, I know nothing.’He never painted celebrated dancers. The faces of his subjects conveyed little even to his contemporaries: just ordinary backup dancers who had yet to go on stage in the future and saw no need in having a grand portrait in their front parlor.Art critics and historians agree that Blue Dancers stand out from all the other works of Degas’s ballet series. The pastel looks like a traditional sketch where an artist can draw a model’s different positions from different points on the same sheet. It looks as though these dancers are actually the same girl, twirling around before going on stage, anxious about it. And this circle of preparation and anxiety return ballet to its original atmosphere, both solemn and festive, which Degas always purposely removed from his ballet pictures, showing instead dancers’ everyday grueling work backstage. These girls seem (or this girl seems) to be performing a graceful ritual dance, as festive and perfect as the one they are going to present to the audience a minute later."},{"paintingTitle":"The orchestra of the Opera","artistName":"Edgar Degas","artistContentId":213253,"paintingContentId":"30f01763-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1870, 56×45 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1200/work/c40/185064.jpg","paintingDescription":"All this complex crowded the composition of the painting \"The Opera orchestra\" was started for the Central figure of a bassoonist.

Because it's concentrated and puzzling challenge to his eternal desire to capture movement, intermediate, elusive, awkward and unexpected moments, of which it is composed.Degas began to write the movement of horses and jockeys, even before it was a funny, historical and one of the most important in the history of painting and film debate: politician, founder of Stanford University, the owner of the railway and steamship U.S. companies Leland Stanford once had an argument with two acquaintances. He claimed that the horse while running, the tears in some moments all 4 feet off the ground. His opponents claimed that one leg is definitely the land concerned, at any time running.

After Maybridge installed along the track 12 cameras, attached to each thread, after the horse, meshing during the running of the filament, led cameras, Stanford managed to win the bet. And Meybridzha is to create chronophotography. After this experiment, he began to use it for shooting 24 camera, filming the movement of animals and people and has published several books with time-lapse shots of these processes.Degas bought a book Meybridzha immediately when it came out in France. But most of the paintings jockey cycle was already written before – made Meybridzha \"electrophotographic investigation of consecutive phases of the movement only confirmed the observations of the artist, who spent every weekend at the track.Picture \"Gentlemen at the races\" Degas wrote in the two approaches, with a difference in 20 years – and a late correction made in 1882, was only the clothing of jockeys and the distant landscape overgrown with time, urban signs, factory chimneys.

It was a period of stagnation between the two breakthroughs. The era of romantic ballet, when dancers learnt to dance on toes almost hovering over the stage, was over. The pathetic valor and fatal passions of Romanticism had faded and diminished. Yet 30 years remained until the overwhelming effect of Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes in Paris aroused a new interest in ballet. In Degas’s time, ballet dancers were downgraded to the status of corps-de-ballet girls. Now, their job was backup dancing during opera performances where they had to show their legs to titillate operagoers’ imagination.There were no great dancers and grand theatrical productions in Paris. Only kitschy interludes and hordes of ‘petits rats’ (the French for ‘little rats’), each hoping to be dancing a solo one day. Rats was a term for teenage working class girls who went to ballet schools to earn their living and meet wealthy bourgeois men whose attention, though hardly altruistic, would be helpful in making a career. Every night, men having special privileges appeared backstage. Degas was one of them. However, his purpose was different from that of most visitors. For several years, he had been applying for permission to paint rehearsals and ballet classes behind the scenes of the Paris Opera. And he took no interest in other enjoyments.Degas’s ‘little rats’ had more in common with laundry girls and seamstresses than with celebrated courtesans and opera divas surrounded by luxury. Only the flimsy, translucent fabrics of their skirts and satin ribbons of their dancing shoes made you think you were watching someone ethereal, weightless, and charming.Ballet Rehearsal is a backstage pastel by Degas, a secret glance at an instant from ballet routine. The bend of the wooden stairs, right above the place the painter is sitting, the dancers’ figures cropped by the right side of the picture are Degas’s favorite tricks. Used together, they produce an impression of a casual, momentary glance, register the reality with no intention to embellish or arrange anything.But this impression is deceitful. Degas always pre-calculated the compositions of his works with pinpoint accuracy, like a meticulous draughtsman or architect. His pictures are as mathematical as they seem artistically effortless. He made his sketches when visiting ballet schools, but preferred to invite young dancers to his studio. There, he made dozens of drawings in search of the most expressive posture or the right angle of view.Once, the police descended on his studio. They had found it suspicious that every morning and every evening, Degas was visited by underage girl dancers. But he appeared to be irreproachable: he did nothing but made the girls be staying still in exhausting positions for hours.

This is one of the most difficult works in the world art. Five centuries of its existence, \"Melancholia\" has acquired volumes of comments and interpretations, but it says a modern authority on the works of dürer Marcel Brion, \"makes it more understandable, easier to interpret, and it really requires much more explanations and comments than any other picture, except perhaps Mona Lisa\".The concentration of symbols and significance of \"Melancholy\" dürer has no equal in the twentieth century is considered to be one of the most significant puzzle, given to mankind by art. Art critics and historians, culture experts and geographers, mathematicians and philosophers, astronomers and astrologers interpreted the engravings of dürer, based on the data of their areas of knowledge. But it is also true that even before the viewer will take the logical attempts to penetrate the meaning of objects and decipher the secret message, he's \"feeling\" has already been given to feel a tart bitterness, viscous heaviness and latent tenderness durasovsky melancholy. Archiv, aware of the vastness of the accumulated art information about \"Melancholy\" by Durer, tried to systematize the answers to those basic questions that first come to mind in its contemplation.Why would dürer appeals to such a strange and unusual topic?\nPerhaps for the simple reason that the belong to the constellation of the melancholic. Letters and notesDurer, his self-portraits without a shadow of a smilethe particular deeply dark contemplation serve as a good illustration of this point.The Viennese art historian Carl Gielow first suggested that the source of the engravings of Durer was the treatise \"Occult philosophy\" of Agrippa Nettesheim. For this German mystic melancholy is more than a state of depression, utrachennoy and depression. Melancholic for him almost equal to genius. The melancholic is not simply overwhelmed by the movement of an organism in its heavy blood and black bile: \"melancholic obsession\", which manages the planet Saturn makes a person of this temperament is capable of the highest forms of spiritual activity. Claiming that all geniuses are melancholic, Agrippa is not alone. This was the opinion of the Italian humanist Marsilio Ficino, and even Aristotle.\"So who are you, finally?\": who is the Central character of the engravings of Durer \"Melancholia\"?\nDefinitions were offered a number: an allegory of melancholy, heavenly genius, winged virgin etc. \"Immediately feeling that the winged woman oppressed by doubts and dissatisfaction\"– says the Medievalist Cecilia, Esselstrom. By the way, occasionally the view was expressed that the figure of melancholy – male: confirmation was given her athletic physique and manly brush. And in General – too similar Melancholy on the master Albrecht: if \"La Gioconda\" only suggest a self-portrait of Leonardo da Vinci, \"Melancholia\" is considered \"spiritual self-portrait of Durer\" almost officially.Himself dürer engraving commented sparingly, but mentioned that the keys on the belt of Melancholy – a symbol of power, and the purse at her feet the riches (in dürer's lifetime, despite its power over the minds and hearts, with a wealth chronically exist, so you can probably guess why purse dismissively thrown to the ground). The head of Melancholy, decorated with a wreath of buttercups and watercress – folk remedies against the dangerous attacks of deadly anguish.The most up to date authoritative interpreters of \"Melancholy\" Erwin Panofsky and Fritz Saxl came to the conclusion that Durer, creating an image of Melancholy, mixed two iconographic tradition of the melancholic image of the popular in his era calendars and medical treatises and the personification of geometry from philosophical treatises that \"led to the intellectualization of melancholy and humanization of geometry\".Why is sleeping cherubs?\nBehind the right shoulder of the winged figure of Melancholy is another character with wings – little chubby Cupid, or Eros. He took a NAP over a book on the edge of millstones, covered with fabric with fringe adds a necessary layer between the rough cold surface of the stone and warm baby skin (a fine workmanship cutter dürer is that you will be alive to enjoy all these textured-temperature points). The most important question here is why Eros is Napping? He's not hovering playfully, as he used to, and does not look out for a victim who could hit with his arrow. Obviously, this must mean that in a state of melancholy that has engulfed the artist, covered earthly desires and passions. This, however, is true not only for the artist but for any thinking and doing: when is melancholy, erotic attraction fades and modestly removed on the second plan. \"Love passed, the Muse came\", how is the order of things in Pushkin.If we agree that melancholia is not destructive and depressive, but rather creative and constructive, here is a short and to the analogy between durasovskom a sleeping Eros, and the idea of sublimation (redirection of biological energy from the sexual needs on the creation and creativity), which will be formulated by Sigmund Freud in 400 years. Why next to the word \"MELENCOLIA\" is also a symbol of \"I\"? What does it mean?\nThere are several versions, is neither universally accepted one. Here are the most interesting.1. Melancholic – as you know, one of the four types of temperament, which was already allotted Hippocrates, Galen and Aristotle. In the time of Durer, the system was well known. For example, his contemporary, Hieronymus Bosch, painting \"The crowning with thorns\"the researchers see as clear an illustration of all 4 temperament types and perceived self-portraits of Bosch (this picture and the so-called \"melancholy beast\" from \"the Garden of earthly delights\", with the right wing), and self-portraits of dürer, characterize these artists as bright representatives of the melancholic type. Some believe that Durer was able to conceive the cycle of the 4 prints, the first of which was \"Melancholia I\", and under the following sequence numbers set would the other types are sanguine, choleric and phlegmatic. However, no evidence that dürer also very interested in other temperaments, no.2. In the XV century Italian humanists relying on the judgment of Plato and Aristotle talked about the special creative abilities inherent in the melancholic temperament, and in Germany, Agrippa Nettesheim suggested a typology which is divided into three melancholic subtype, and dürer with her, apparently, was familiar. The first are those of the imagination: the craftsmen, artists and poets. Second – the man of reason: scientists and statesmen. Third – people SVERKAJUSHEGO, intuitive knowledge: theologians and philosophers. Assume that dürer called the engraving \"Melancholia I\", because belong to the first type of the melancholic. 3. According to third version, inverting the sense of melancholy for the artist upside the head, I is not a number and the letter of the Latin alphabet. The short word \"I\", second person singular from the verb \"eo\" means \"Go away!\". Therefore, in the engraving of dürer creates something like a magic spell to get rid of sadness and anxiety: \"Melancholy, go away!\" or \"Melancholy, away!\"Why is the engraving depicted so many tools?\nArt historian Paola Volkova after Panofsky and Saksham believes that the Central theme of the engraving \"Melancholia\" is human cognition that is moving in ascending steps. The first level is knowledge of the craft, carried out through objects, tangible things, that's why \"lower tier\" dürer scattered saw, plane, ruler, hammer, nails, a perfect sphere, carved by some master, is at the pinnacle of excellence to be achieved by the craftsman. The second level of cognition is the scientific, experimental: instruments – compasses, scales, hourglass, magic Board, melting crucibles alchemist, polygon (\"magic crystal\"); on this second level the knowledge is transferred from the craft of concreteness to the abstractions. Well, the third and highest level is the knowledge of the super-rational, intuitive, connects man with God. Thought Volkova, this level of knowledge that represents stairs – it is lawful to associate with the ladder of Jacob's dream (Gen. 28:12-16), on which the angels ascend to heaven and descend to earth and which serves for communication with the Almighty.A particularly interesting and controversial subject – table of figures, engraved on the wall of the tower. This so-called magic square: the sum of the numbers in each vertical, horizontal and diagonal equals 34. From Agrippa Nettesheim, fascinated by the Kabbalah, were already \"square of Jupiter,\" but distinguished geometer Albrecht Durer has made its (sometimes called the \"square of Saturn\"), encrypting it in numbers that are significant to him personally: for example, the day my mother died (16.05) and the year of creation of \"Melancholy\" (the average figures in the bottom row make 1514). However, I think there's undeciphered and numeric codes. German researcher dürer abi Warburg writes that the first magic square appeared not Agrippa, and in the Arab astrological book Picatriх and therefore is \"a vestige of ancient pagan practice.\"And by the way, unanswered remains the question, why not dürer depicted the artist's tools – brushes, paints, palette, palette knife, cutter?Why in the sky of both the comet and the rainbow?\nIn the top left corner, Durer placed the landscape: the water surface formed a very long horizontal strokes, a small architectural fragment, and celestial phenomena – rainbows and speeding comet, or, as they said, \"tailed star\". In addition to the purely artistic effect, giving joy to the eye from the comparison of lines (parallel, concentrically converging at one point and a curve forming a semi-circle), what the semantic component are the rainbow and the comet?I must say that Durer was fond of astronomy, was involved in compiling star maps, and on the roof of his house in Nuremberg was a small Observatory, where he could observe the movement of celestial bodies.The appearance on the horizon of the comet – a rare and disturbing – always, not only in the time of Durer, was seen as a harbinger of something terrible. So it was in the beginning of the XVI century, when the crumbling foundations of the feudal order and there was political and religious upheavals, and the Europeans felt the uncertainty and the panic came from in the movement of \"tectonic plates\" under his feet. In the notebooks of dürer in 1503-the year is an interesting testimony about the disturbing atmosphere of exaltation around him then: \"The greatest miracle I've ever seen in my entire life, happened in 1503, when many people began to fall on the cross, and especially many children. Of them I had seen one in this shape, I then painted. And he fell to the maid Ayer, who was sitting in the back of the house Pirkheimerdirectly on the shirt, on linen fabric. And she was so upset that I cried and really complained, because she was afraid that she would die from it. Also I saw in the sky a comet\".Comet in the perception of dürer's symbol, of course, the apocalyptic, the \"star of Wormwood\" from Revelation: \"The third angel sounded, and there fell from heaven a great star, blazing like a torch, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers and on the springs of water. The name of the star is called wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood, and many men died of the waters because they were made bitter\" (Rev. 8:10-11)But then it's time to ask: what's a rainbow (moreover, in reality, these phenomena are unlikely to occur simultaneously)? Notice that dürer is not just a rainbow, but a rainbow over the water. Which clearly refers to the Book of Genesis, which tells about the end of the flood and the Covenant (contract) of God with Noah and his descendants that now no one else will be ruined and destroyed, a symbol of what will become a rainbow: \"I do set My bow in the cloud, and it was a sign of the Covenant between Me and the earth. And when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen [My] in the cloud; and I will remember My Covenant which is between Me and between you and between all soul living in all flesh; and there will be a flood to destroy all flesh\". (Gen., 9:13-15)It turns out that in the upper left corner of \"Melancholy\" is not a conventional landscape, a case which just serve as a backdrop. On the contrary: they played the universal disasters. Well, as a person, gripped by melancholy, with equal probability, we can expect immense bitterness of the last judgment, and the ineffable mercy of God.Why the inscription MELENCHOLIA I keep a bat?\nBat represents nightmares – no wonder one of the great European Carver, Francisco Goya, \"the sleep of reason\" will accompany flying in a chaotic rush of owls and batsthe heralds and the living symbols of misfortune and death. But dürer also important, at least, two semantic point. First, a bat holding a banner with the words \"Melancholia I\", and this may imply that melancholy is such a special, purely as night, some twilight of consciousness, when a person can suddenly be revealed to those meanings that are inaccessible to consciousness day, rational. A similar condition of special susceptibility to the unknown, to the call of destiny, to what does not fit into the understandable \"day\" order of things, good captures Pushkin's \"Verses written at night during insomnia\":I can't sleep, no fire;Everywhere darkness and sleep and irritated.The clock just monotonousDistributed near meParks Indian the babbling,Sleeping nights the flutter,Life mouse and running...What are you worried about me?What do you mean, boring whisper?A reproach or a murmurMe lost day?From me what do you want?You call or prophesy?I understand you wantI sense in you looking for...The second point that can Express the bat in dürer, is polemical, but he needed to say. Perhaps the bat hints at the frustration of the artist in the rational knowledge of being, to the futility of the human adventure. Of course, dürer was a Renaissance man in the sense that it is alive and deeply interested in natural science, and his achievements in geometry, geography, theory of fortification cannot be questioned. However, due to the peculiarities of temperament and a deep personal religiosity, he was far from the notorious Renaissance of the Titanic – the idea that man can in knowledge and creativity to compete with the Creator. \"Then not seem absurd, – says Marcel Brion, – what dürer was trying to convey, on the one hand, my disappointment in an unsuccessful search of the secret that science has revealed it to him, and, possibly, mathematics and physics do not possess the key to this nagging mystery; but at the same time, he expresses his firm belief in the power of the human mind, is able to disperse the nightmares, which represents a bat.\"Hourglass - a symbol of the transience of life?\nAs allegory watch traditionally indicate the limited time of human life, reminiscent of her limbs. But in this it is quite clear the symbol of dürer there are more subtle nuances and gradations of meaning. Interestingly, hourglass – motif in dürer not a single, end-to-end. \"Melancholy\" are often combined in the cycle of so-called \"workshops of prints\" with the other two \"The knight, Death and the Devil\"and \"St. Jerome in his cell\". So, the hourglass appear in each of the three works. In one case, the hourglass holds Death in the face of the Rider: it's a reminder that time is running out inexorably, but the Knight is looking straight ahead, ignoring the warning, as if to show that time and death have no power over those who have high purpose. In \"Jerome\" hourglass are arranged quite differently, Durer depicts the Saint in his cell, more like not at refuge of the monk, and the office of the scientist-humanist (and at the office of the Durer). Jerome is busy with his life – long and painstaking translation of the old and New Testaments into Latin, and the watch keeps quiet regularity of his diligent training. \"Melancholia\" was created after these two prints, and an hourglass here incorporates both the semantic connotation and the inexorability of time and its reasonable regularity.Why beast at the feet of Melancholy looks so drained? What does it symbolize?\nCurled up, the dog looks scary skinny, lurking through the skin, muscles and bones. But perhaps this, and not hiding any deep meanings, in addition to the desire of Durer to show your own graphic virtuosity in the depiction of a living being, frozen in the most difficult to image position, the ability accurately to study anatomy. And the appearance of the engraving of a dog attributed to the fact that this animal, which is protected by Saturn, a gloomy and cold planet, \"patron\" of the melancholic (as sanguine obey Jupiter, phlegmatic – moon, and choleric – Mars). By the way, like an hourglass, dog has all the three \"master prints\".And whether there is in Durer's engraving of biographical preconditions for the creation of \"Melancholy\"?\nIt may seem that an intellectual puzzle \"Melancholia\" – the fruit of the pure speculative character, and game intelligence. However, biographers emphasize that the engraving appeared under the influence of a very specific life circumstances of the artist. In may 1514, the year after a long illness died, his mother, Barbara Durer. She lived a hard life, gave birth to 18 children, of whom survived sons Hans, Andres and Albrecht, has always been God-fearing, but sometimes was too hard on Durer, and the relationship eventually lost its credibility. In her dying hours, when, according to Marcel Brion, \"old Barbara, who lost sight... say, gained for a moment on his deathbed, the former beauty of youth\"her son's first was the idea of \"Melancholy\", but the complete picture for a long time didn't work, lacked details, the idea could not gain a complete incarnation. The death of his mother, he experienced hard and then he would describe it in his \"memory book\": \"And before his death, she blessed me and commanded to live in a world with this many fine teachings that I was wary of sins... And she was very much afraid of death, but said that is not afraid to stand before God. She's dead, and I noticed that she saw something terrible. For she asked for Holy water, though could not speak. Immediately after that, her eyes closed. I saw also how death was inflicted two major blows to the heart and as she closed her mouth and eyes and departed in agony. I prayed for her. I experience such pain that you can't Express\".In the biographical novel of Stanislav Darnitskogo \"Durer\" subsequent events as follows: \"And the house was filled with old women and nuns, nowhere Polyanski of the death of the old Durresi. They all demanded something, gave some advice, but Albrecht never listened to anyone and saw no one. He ran away from home. Went down to the cemetery at the Church of St. Sebald, where now beside their father will be laid to rest and his mother. Hesitated at the door of the Cathedral, but then walked on to Pegnitz (river in Nuremberg – ed.). Heavy twilight bore down on the city. The twilight hour of melancholy, indecision and longing. From Pegnitz slowly rising fog. Flapped in the air someone's wings. A bird or a bat? He somehow had the winged woman, but so clear that he looked around, hoping to see her. One, the image faded. Beside the road lay a huge boulder anchored in the ground. A stray dog with an inverted stomach and protruding ribs stared at him hungry, waiting eyes... on that terrible night details are not given to it suddenly prints themselves have developed together. He made it his \"Melancholy\"\".Author: Anna Yesterday"},{"paintingTitle":"Christ among the teachers","artistName":"Albrecht Durer","artistContentId":200491,"paintingContentId":"315e90a1-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1506, 65×80 cm • Oil, Wood","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy800/work/255/551458.jpg","paintingDescription":"There is still no description of this artwork.

The circumstances of the creation of the \"Holiday beads\"\nAlmost every art description of the \"Feast of the rosary\" indicates that dürer created the picture in \"the second Venetian period\". This is an important remark, if you understand what is the difference between the first and second comings of dürer in Venice. When a native of Nuremberg, Albrecht dürer was the first time in the \"city of lagoons\", where the painting was dominated by the dynasty of masters Bellini (1, 2, 3), he was only about 23 years and nobody knew. The young dürer, who had not seen before \"live\" any of the ancient sculptures and not familiar with Italian painting that shocked him with its freedom in the handling of paint, light, a naked human body, as of a Wayfarer would visit the studios of famous Venetians and eagerly absorbed what they saw. Dürer and the Venetians reacted then to each other with cautious curiosity.But after 11 years in Venice came a Mature 34-year-old master, \"Messer Alberto on the other side of the Alps\"whose fame in Northern Europe was already booming, though not yet brought stable income. Dürer has recently released their epic \"the Apocalypse\", a series of 15 magnificent engravings-illustrations for \"Revelation\" John the theologian, which sold a massive for its time numbers. Arriving in Venice for the second time in the new status, dürer found that the Venetian painters met him jealously. He complained in letters to each Willibald Pirkheimer: \"I have many good friends among the Italians who warn me to not eat or drink with their painters. Many of them are my enemies; they copy my work in churches and wherever they can find them, and then scold them and say that they are not in the ancient taste and therefore bad\". Dürer apparently during this visit he met with artists of the new generation, whose talent threatens to outshine even in the future, Bellini – Giorgioneand Titianbut not found with them common language: the Venetians above all, art set color options, durasovsky engraving chiselled lines left them indifferent. The Italians unobtrusive given to understand dürer, in flavor in comparison with the Venetians almost a layman, his paintings \"weak from the point of view of color\".In addition, he sadly discovers that in almost all art shops sell crude counterfeits of his prints, even if forged autograph – recognizable letter \"A\" and \"D\", which are located one above the other. Soon it becomes clear and the name of the plagiarist – someone not known to Durer Marcantonio Raimondi(a we know him as a student of Raphael). Outraged, he filed a lawsuit in the Venetian Signoria is the body responsible to take care of the public good and justice. But the fact he could not win: the court allows Marcantonio and then copy all they want, just remove the signature of dürer.Not finding among the Italians understand, dürer was to stay close to his: in Venice were considerable and influential Diaspora of German entrepreneurs who owned a Palace on the Grand canal, the Fondaco dei Tedeschi is a famous German compound kind of financial and cultural center. Paid the artists, the Germans are quite generous, and the Italians were honored to receive their orders. When in the early sixteenth century German farmstead burned down (and evil tongues claimed that the fires that often falls on the German the merchants, was not accidental – it was a hint that their political and business interests hurt Venice), to paint the Fondaco dei Tedeschi took Giorgione and Titian. Touched by fire was the German parish Church of St. Bartholomew, near which were buried the rich and noble of the Germans. To write for the rebuilding of the temple a large altarpiece, this time German merchants decided to entrust his compatriot, by the way, appeared in Venice, Albrecht dürer. The displeasure of the masters of the Italians was understandable: in the hands of the \"German barbarian\" left a large order, for which he was promised a substantial sum – a hundred and ten Rhenish guilders. About Durer went to Venice a nasty false gossip.Features and secrets of the paintings of Albrecht dürer's \"the Feast of the rosary\"\nIn the beginning of 1506, dürer bought in the shops on the Rialto bridge, the best paint and went to work in the hope that by Easter it the \"Feast of the rosary\" will decorate the Cathedral of St. Bartholomew. He's not devoted customers in their ambitions, but for myself decided to film it should prove a vain Italian and Northern masters know something about painting and coloring.The iconographic type of the \"feast of the rosary\" – \"the Holy interview\", Sacra Conversazionewhere Madonna and child are depicted surrounded by saints and donors. The problem of this type of painting to glorify the virgin, hoping for her patronage of the city or community. The theme of the painting, dürer chose \"the feast of the rosary\" or \"the feast of the rose-laying of wreaths\". Catholics believed that the rosary was invented in the thirteenth century, St. Dominic (founder of the Dominican monastic order). According to legend, the Holy virgin Mary appeared and presented the rosary, each of which was impregnated with the scent of roses. This story was particularly popular among the German Dominicans, so the left of the throne of the virgin, dürer has placed St. Dominic in a black monastic cloak.The infant Christ places a wreath of roses (rosary, i.e. \"wreath of roses\" – the traditional name of the Catholic rosary) on the head of Pope Julius II, and the virgin Mary adorns the wreath to the kneeling of the German Emperor Maximilian. Dad crowded with the clergy, as the Emperor lay. The soaring angels putti holding behind Maria's green velvet curtains, and above her head is a Golden crown and also distribute all pink wreaths, as if in blessing, and including all without exception in General upbeat atmosphere of the festival. In wreaths that alternate white and red buds, the first of which symbolize joy (according to another interpretation, the purity of the virgin Mary), and the second – the future sufferings of Christ. In a dense crowd, typical of the Church festivities are distinguishable and specific historical figures. SV.Dominic lays his crown on the cardinal Domenico Grimani, a famous Venetian patron of the arts, and at the right edge of the picture, all in black, shows the architect Girolamo Todeski who designed the German compound. There among the characters and myself dürer – in the upper right corner of the tree.For the \"Feast of the rosary\" Durer did a huge number of drawings, trying to get to crowded not perceived as congestion. In the spring he realized that his perfectionism Easter is not time, it soon became clear that no time and Trinity. Customers-Germans warmed, of course, Patriotic pathos of the picture (the German Emperor is depicted here as blessed as the Pope), but were not happy with the violation of deadlines, they hurried dürer and threatened to reduce the fee to 85 guilders. Dürer depicted in the corner of the picture, holding a scroll on which is written, that he had completed \"the Feast of the rosary\" in five months, but the letters dürer suggests that the work lasted much longer. Only in the autumn of 1506 the Germans got the picture.The fate of \"the Feast of the rosary\" by Durer\nThe picture has not yet been transferred to the Church of the workshop of Durer, when the desire to see it expressed two of the most famous man of Venice is elderly, but still holding the palm and influence in the hands of the chief artist of the Republic Giovanni Belliniand the Venetian Doge Leonardo Loredana.Visit of the Doge, he waited with an unpleasant feeling. Reason to fear the scandal he was good. And it wasn't that the picture could compete in its picturesque quality to the masterpieces of the Venetian. It was in politics: unity in the prayer of Pope Julius II and the German Emperor Maximilian Loredana could see the hint of unfriendly to Venice, the Union of Germany and Rome (and sometimes actually more than once: when, for example, in 1508, the year Maximilian will travel to Rome for the coronation, Venice will officially forbid him to cross their territory, and it will be an occasion for war, and another division of land). But Doge has behaved diplomatically and wisely. He reasoned that the Christian peoples wiser to maintain peace among themselves, because they have a common external threat – the Ottomans. And Albrecht dürer Loredana was invited to be the artist of the Venetian Republic (an honor for a foreigner!) with an annual income of 200 ducats. Dürer offer with gratitude, but also with relief rejected: even in Venice would have to leave his picture, and he returns home, he really misses Nuremberg.Giovanni Bellini, according to legend, came from the \"Holiday beads\" in delight. Even say that dürer did in the picture is a direct nod to the master's art – angel with lute in the centre seem to have gone from the altar, Bellini. But not only that touched the man. \"What shining pure colors! How much life in them!\" he repeated to himself. Could not resist the comparison, implying himself and his brother Gentile: almost like the best of the Venetian masters! And what a fine job! But do not show any \"Messer Alberto,\" he of the brush, which he used when he wrote \"the Feast of the rosary\"? Dürer readily put on the table their tools. Long old Bellini went through them, spit in his hands, and then said: \"But there is no brush that you wrote hair of the blessed virgin!\" \"No– he replied Albrecht dürer, – all my brushes here\". Then Bellini demanded from dürer to show how he holds the brush when prescribing the most subtle fragments of his paintings. If that's so, \"German\", almost perpendicular to the canvas? So here's the thing!.. More in Venice no one would dare to doubt that \"Messer Alberto that side of the Alps\" – the great master. Friend Pirkheimer in Nuremberg dürer comic boastfulness wrote: \"I declare to you that the better my paintings you will not find in the whole world...\" and added quite seriously: \"I have silenced all the painters who said that in print I'm good, but painting I do not know how to handle the colors\".Exactly one hundred years spent painting dürer in Venice, in 1606, the year she was sent to Prague by Emperor Rudolf II Habsburg was a great connoisseur of art and at any cost wanted to get the legendary work of dürer. However, after the death of Rudolf II, the film went through hard times: the paint layer began to collapse, she was excluded from the collection of Prague castle and has long been hidden behind the walls of the Strahov monastery in Prague. The picture with the appearance of which is considered to be not only dürer but also all German art triumphantly stepped into the Renaissance era, a long time could not see the audience, in different periods it went through several rough restorations, making the paint began to look more aggressive and sharper. In the twentieth century, the government of Czechoslovakia a decade and a half led complex negotiations with Starkovski monastery, as a result of their in 1934, the year \"the Feast of the rosary\" was finally purchased by and transferred to the National gallery in Prague.Author: Anna Yesterday"},{"paintingTitle":"Adam and eve","artistName":"Albrecht Durer","artistContentId":200491,"paintingContentId":"315e90a3-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1504, 25×19.3 cm • Engraving, Copper, Paper laid","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1200/work/0ce/462954.jpg","paintingDescription":"There is still no description of this artwork.

And what catastrophe was waiting for Baumgartners the altar at the end of the twentieth century?The history of the altarIn 1498, the year countrymen dürer in Nuremberg – brothers Lucas and Stefan from the patrician family of Baumgartnerhof – commissioned artist triptych for the altar of the local Church of St. Catherine (Katharinekirche). Stefan just recently made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and the altar was supposed to be a kind of gratitude that all went well.Saints with the valves of the altar of BaumgartnerhofIt is believed that dürer first hunt wrote the sash and only a few months later reluctantly proceeded to the Central panel. It and is clear: nature for Nativity scene still had to pick up, but the models for the saints George and Eustace was literally at hand. Of course, they were themselves brothers Paumgartner. Pilgrim Stefan embodied the image of St. George (in the Russian tradition called the victorious)  the left leaf the obvious way of showing that he emerged victorious from all road troubles and spiritual dangers. A symbol of evil dragon written by dürer in the form of a winged beast, covered in scales with a forked tongue and spindle-shaped tail, encircling the right leg of St. George. Saint is depicted at the moment when he pulls on the leash of the defeated dragon into the city, where the monster will kill the eyes of the assembled townspeople.On the right leaf written great Martyr Eustathius, a legendary figure and the patron of hunters Catholics. He was a commander named Place when the Roman emperors Titus and Trajan, and Christian, who took the name of Eustace, became after hunting he saw a deer with a luminous cross between its horns, and therefore on the standard of the Saint is traditionally portrayed stag head with a crucifix. Eustache, who, according to hagiographic literature, after his conversion has undergone no less suffering than the biblical job, Albrech dürer gave manly features of the second brother of Baumgartnerhof – Lucas.Apparently, this was the first time in the history of art when the artist dared to depict sponsors in the role of the saints.The Central panel and conceited PatriciaFor the rest of baumgartners \"clan\" was not the secret that fake panel, which will become the altar doors, dürer extremely successful, and recognizable Lukas and Stefan now have a chance to remain for centuries. The scandal in \"the Holy family\" broke the noble: on the altar threw off all Paumgartner, and all the glory will go only those two.Dürer, meanwhile, had just finished working on a Central panel with a scene of the Nativity by cleverly combining the North-European iconographic staging of the figures in Italian careful observance of perspective and proportions. He portrayed the elder Joseph, somewhat clumsily on his knees, and a truncated bottom edge of the Board, majestic in its simplicity Mary in a blue robe with a white cloth on his head and a tiny figure of the baby surrounded by angels. \"Dürer– says Silvia Borghese – want to tell a very human and modern history, far from the idealism of Italian painting and is close to the Northern relief naturalism\".Architectural ruins, acts as a backdrop for the events was partly a tribute to dürer's trip to Italy, where he was particularly fascinated by the works of the artist Andrea Mantegna based on optics and geometry. Dürer has not yet reaches an impressive perspective illusionism, as Mantegna in the image of the famous arches with frescoes \"Procession of Jacob to death\" but durasovsky unusual interior with a Central panel of the altar of Baumgartnerhof where the walls are interspersed with arched niches, consistently leading the viewer's eye to the main arch leading out of the room to the fields, trees and clear sky, very interesting as an experience of rational building space.Alas, thoughtful composition, so carefully designed by Durer, fell victim to the vanity of Baumgartnerhof. The principle of \"who pays – the Piper calls the tune\" cannot be neglected in the name of art: dürer experienced financial difficulties. He reluctantly agreed to place next to Joseph and Mary all eager glorification of Baumgartnerhof. However, it was not only in glory: according to existed in the country of superstition, the one whose image got when living in a space the Church altar, was freed after death from the punishment for their earthly sins. And because a disproportionately small figures Nuremberg Paumgartner with the family arms at the feet with the molestation of insects filled the entire front plan of a triptych. Behind Joseph, he again wrote to Stefan and Lucas, familiar to us from the side flaps, along with their father, Martin Paumgartner and another bearded stranger. On the left, at the feet of Mary, dürer placed the female half of the house of Baumgartnerhof – daughter-in-law Martin, Barbara Baumgartner, maiden of Polymer, daughters Barbara and Mary. Their pompous hats the symbol of their family pride, is in sharp contrast to the simple cover from the head of the blessed virgin. Up to the present day is not reached, another two altar panels depicting saints Catherine and Barbara – they are, supposedly, dürer or his apprentices wrote with the wives of Lucas and Stefan. Closely examining the genealogy of Baumgartnerhof, the researchers came to the conclusion that an unidentified bearded man next to the patricians is the second husband of Barbara, Hans Sanbag. He was not Paumgartner, but to be written with a brush dürer, obviously, wanted him.It is not quite clear why dürer wrote the Christmas, traditionally portrayed as a night scene with a glowing in the sky a star pointing the way to the Christ child by the Magi, in the light of day. From dürer not only blazes the solar disk in the upper left corner and a glowing angel descends from heaven, but Joseph, despite the day, holding a burning lamp. I think that the lamp in the hands of Joseph – a symbol of contrasting material (\"dark\") of the world – divine, Durer borrowed from the works of the old Flemish masters.Records and the census of the altar of BaumgartnerhofMore than a hundred years Baumgartners altar adorned St. Catherine's Church in Nuremberg, and in 1613, the year it was bought by the Bavarian Kurfurst Maximilian I. By the time the triptych was in need of refurbishing, and kurfust submitted it for restoration painter Johann Georg Fischer. The latter approached the case \"with the light\": he not only restored, but also in its sole discretion finished work of dürer. For example, picky Fischer was not satisfied with plain black the back side of the valves, and would-be restorer attributed to the figures of the brothers Baumgartner landscape background and Eustace even supplied a live horse instead of a deer and the helmet is written by Durer caps, and did it so well and with such subtle knowledge of other durasovsky works, which until the early twentieth century, his blatant interference was not exposed by critics.Little Paumgartner with paintings by Durer lost in the same the XVII century: unknown, Fisher or, perhaps, someone else decided that the figures of the donors, this intolerable relic of Gothic art, is no longer in Vogue, and wrote them down. Clearing, restoration and opening of the original form of the Altar of Paumgartner was made only in 1903, the year. Once in the collection of the Munich Old Pinakothek, durasovsky triptych, it seemed, was immune from further barbaric interventions, however, and his misadventures have not ended. \"Acid killer\" 21 APR 1988 Baumgartners altar, along with two other paintings dürer (1, 2) doused with sulphuric acid 51-year-old Hans-Joachim Bohlmann, causing the gallery of the damage in 70 million German marks. A homeless pensioner Bohlmann was not a random psycho, a serial maniac, which blew all of the European Newspapers. His first attempt at the famous painting he made back in 1977 year, some time with impunity, and holding in awe art gallery of Hamburg, Hanover, lübeck and Essen, Dusseldorf and Hanover. Damaged among his paintings were the paintings of Rubens and Rembrandt. It is filled with acid \"the goldfish\" by Paul Klee. Mental health problems were diagnosed in Bollmann in his youth. In 1974, the year he was subjected to lobotomies, but not cured. And when, in 1977, the year his wife, myvshie window fell down and crashed, Bohlmann began to retaliate against works of art. The object of his special hatred for unexplained reasons, was dürer. The serial killer, dubbed \"the acid killer,\" was sentenced three times to imprisonment, which each time ended with the recognition of his insanity and placement in a psychiatric hospital, where Bohlmann successfully ran. Exactly two decades, he has kept at Bay the Museum world. The account of his \"trophies\" – masterpieces, disfigured with acid, was close to 60, and the total damage Balmanno museums, – to 138-mi million Euro. Every escape or early release was accompanied by a newspaper sensation and slight panic, while in 2008, the year he died from cancer.Despite the fact that the work of dürer in the Old Pinakothek at Bollmann took about two liters of sulfuric acid, \"Baumgartners altar\" has gone through another restoration successfully – he, we understand, to vandalism and rough interventions in the five centuries of its history was not used to.Author: Anna Yesterday"},{"paintingTitle":"Self-portrait","artistName":"Albrecht Durer","artistContentId":200491,"paintingContentId":"315e90ab-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1500, 67×49 cm • Oil, Wood","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1200/work/0a9/331888.jpg","paintingDescription":"There is still no description of this artwork.

Written in that short period in the artist's life, when his work began to sell and brought him international fame, she, in recognition of the hopper, is permeated with a sense of loneliness that sometimes feels everyone in the city. In the city, which, as a living organism, suffers, sings, laughs, or, as here, resting after a hard day. Somehow, it seems that the hopper painting depicts a very ordinary night unremarkable Thursday.According to one version, which was put forward by hopper biographer Gail Levin, the creation of \"night Owls\" artist inspired van Gogh painting \"Cafe terrace at night\"/ \"Night cafe in Arles\" (1888). A passionate lover of all things French, Hopper just could not get past the famous paintings that in January 1942 it was exhibited in new York. That's just the evening in a cafe he interpreted in his own inimitable manner. Summer terrace with weightless tables turned into a typical American diner with Windows-\"aquariums\". A lazy languor of the warm night in Arles was replaced by sad-poignant-new York night.According to another version (which has become common), for the appearance of \"night Owls\" we would like to thank Ernest Hemingway and his story \"the Killers.\" A tiny story, only three pages, and they are a brilliant way nothing happens. Only the dialogues are very similar to those, which are famous for the films of Quentin Tarantino. If you stick to this version, you may notice that the artist changed the dining time on the night and added an additional character. And when in 1946 in Hollywood decided to film \"Killers\", the basis for it was the picture of the hopper than the Hemingway story. Speaking in favor of this not only the typical kuperovskaya scenes used in the film, but the appearance of this additional character. Because it is simply impossible to imagine a decent murder without the participation of a fatal beauty.Author: Eugene Sidelnikov"},{"paintingTitle":"Office in a small town","artistName":"Edward Hopper","artistContentId":235517,"paintingContentId":"3ce99501-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1953, 71.1×101.6 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy800/work/33f/61876.jpg","paintingDescription":"There is still no description of this artwork.

In childhood, when Edward had just started to draw, the main motive of his works was exactly seascapes. Many years later, the artist and his wife Jo spent a lot of time on Cape cod and returned to the images of the coast, giving special preference to the beacons. In this respect, the painting \"rooms by the sea\" can be called unique. Although here and there is the sea, but the main role on the canvas, paradoxically, is given to... sunlight.Most of the paintings of hopper features one amazing feature that is not immediately notice. First, it's just the feeling of a light dissonance. And then it becomes clear that most of the work of the artist written from an unusual angle or point of view. It often does not cover the entire scene as a whole, and is limited to one, sometimes quite unexpected, creating a sense accidentally caught the moment (\"New York cinema\", 1939). It could look like stills from the film or pictures, looking at that we think that this was taken from the corner (\"Night owls\", 1942), is – from the window of the house opposite (\"Office in a small town\", 1953) this is from under the mound near the railway tracks (\"House by the railroad\", 1925), and this is from the window of a passing over the surface of the subway car (\"Room in new York\", 1932).Given this feature, the painting \"rooms by the sea\" becomes the exclusive double, even triple. First, the Hopper finally allows himself to portray the light-filled empty space, without having to enter into this space of people. Secondly, the picture painted, like many others, from an unusual angle, but there is no object that would fall into the \"frame\" entirely. And the sea is starting right on the doorstep, creates a feeling of almost fairy-like and illusory. It is not surprising that recent work hopper is referred to the genre known as \"magical realism\".Author: Eugene Sidelnikov"},{"paintingTitle":"The Pont des arts","artistName":"Edward Hopper","artistContentId":235517,"paintingContentId":"3ce99505-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1907, 58.6×71.3 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1000/work/427/292795.jpeg","paintingDescription":"There is still no description of this artwork.

In 1910, the artist returned from France to America, never to leave its borders. But for a long time his work remains visible the influence of the French Impressionists. Admiring the works Cezanne and Monet Hopper began to change the color palette of his paintings, making it more colorful and bright. The house in this picture brightly lit by the sun, which, apparently, already on the wane. But in the deep shadows and barren Windows of the building can be seen a kind of melancholy anxiety and abandonment. Along with this when looking at the canvas appears unaccountable feeling that behind these Windows, from the depths of dark rooms for you someone is watching intently.Hopper often uses in his paintings of strict horizontal element, as if forcibly detaching the real world, in which there is the viewer, and the space within the painting. Here this element be the railroad tracks that draws off of the attention and not allow you to see the house as a whole. And the more the viewer tries to see, the more impenetrable it becomes an image.\"House by the railroad\" famous in the first place so that this work became the first painting acquired by the new York Museum of modern art, founded in 1928. Also, very noteworthy is the fact that the house with the paintings of hopper was the basis for the construction of the mansion, which became known as the \"Bates Motel\" from the Alfred Hitchcock film \"Psycho.\" This mansion was the most expensive decoration in the film and cost the Studio 15 thousand dollars. Thanks to the masterwork of Hitchcock, as well as numerous sequels (for example, in 2013 in the USA successful series \"Bates Motel\"), leaf hopper periodically experiencing a new wave of popularity, gaining fame dark and ominous.

In his youth, he studied law and economics at the University of Moscow, and was later hired as a professor of Roman law at the University of Dorpat in Estonia. He was 30 years old when he began his studies in painting, focusing on life drawing, sketching, and anatomy, at the University of Munich. \r\n\r\nHe was not immediately accepted into the school as an art student, and so in the meantime he began learning art by himself, gaining artistic insight from Monet’s Haystacks and Richard Wagner’s composition Lohengrin. He was also influenced by the teachings of anthroposophy, as such, his abstract works were a creation of his intense philosophical beliefs, based on his own personal experiences with art. The devotion to inner beauty remained a central theme in his art. \r\n\r\nIn 1914, after the beginning of World War I, Kandinsky returned to Moscow, where he did not find much inspiration in the art world. In 1921, he returned to Munich, where he taught at the Bauhaus school of architecture, until it was closed by the Nazis in 1933. He was an active art theorist, publishing a number of books on art theory, and developing a complex and deeply emotional theory about the ability of colors and shapes to represent sound and evince human emotion. He eventually traveled to the United States to lecture on the topic. \r\n\r\nAfter the Bauhaus was closed, Kandinsky moved to Paris, where he was mostly isolated from the other Impressionist or Cubist painters. He later became a French citizen, and lived the rest of his days there. His legacy lives on in the newly created Kandinsky Award, which rewards a promising young Russian artist a 55,000 euro prize, and attempts to elevate the status of contemporary Russian art.

We can say that this work is one of the most important and significant not only for the early period of Kandinsky, but for his career. In the end, this cloth gave the name of the creative Association, established in 1911 by Vasily Kandinsky and Franz Marc. After only three years the group \"Blue rider\" managed to put on the head of the German painting tradition and to develop fundamentally new forms of art.Wassily Kandinsky never did allegations that the Association was named in honor of his paintings. The artist only once admitted that the name was a tribute to both the founders: \"We both loved blue. I horsemen, mark of horses\". Riders really are heroes of his paintings (1, 2, 3, 4) as often as Franz Marc blue horses portrays (1, 2, 3). For these heroes Kandinsky even after leaving in the abstract periodically returned to figurative painting, for example, in 1915, depicts George on horseback.The painting \"Blue rider\" became the first scenic work of the artist, depicting man on horseback. Although it was written long before the rejection of Kandinsky's painting from the subject, some critics already see in it the prerequisites of the future style of the artist. Dressed in a blue horseman, who gallops across the green meadow is depicted as if carelessly, his blurry figure and the face does not allow to guess the gender or age. The blurred outline of a person with blurred background create a sense of quick, rapid movements, leaving no doubt that the rider rushing to their invisible targets at full speed. Some researchers have proposed the hypothesis that human hands lies the infant. According to this theory, one can imagine a whole fascinating story, romantic or tragic, hiding behind the canvas.Author: Eugene Sidelnikov"},{"paintingTitle":"Composition VIII","artistName":"Wassily Kandinsky","artistContentId":189246,"paintingContentId":"3d504611-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1923, 140×201 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy800/work/ab8/174725.jpg","paintingDescription":"Kandinsky believed that painting one of the most important in his work – the precise expression of his theory of emotional properties of color, line and shape.

Horizontal sound \"cold and gloomy\", vertical \"heat and high\" sharp corners \"warm, sharp, active and yellow\" and direct \"cold, reserved and red.\"The artist understood all the difficulties that can occur in an unprepared viewer, and said that this picture requires a different approach in the introduction: it is necessary to first examine it up close, then relax your eyes and allow seen to penetrate to the part of the brain that responds to music.Despite the innovation of this work, there are recurring motifs from previous works by Kandinsky. If you look closely at the left part of the picture, you can see a stylized picture of the mountain with the cross. In the earlier paintings - \"Picture with an Archer\", \"Moscow I\" - we will find the Church on the hill. Kandinsky was a deeply religious man and associate religion with \"what we look for in art\".\"Composition VIII\" was one of the first paintings purchased by Solomon Guggenheim for his extensive collection.

He was invited there in 1922 by Walter Gropius, the founder of the school-workshop. Kandinsky was very close to his ideas, and he gladly accepted the offer, especially since his old friends and colleagues worked in Bauhaus. He teamed up with Paul Klee, Lyonel Feininger and Alexej von Jawlensky to form the so-called ‘Blue Four’, named in memory of the ‘Blue Rider’.Kandinsky taught at the Bauhaus until 1933, when the art school was closed by the Nazis. Over this period, the artist together with his colleagues and students had to move from Weimar to Dessau, and later to Berlin. Despite the attacks and criticism from the right-wing parties, the Bauhaus has continued its work. Kandinsky inspired his students to express themselves creatively, because he was inspired himself. Kandinsky taught the courses of analytical drawing, fundamentals of artistic design and, perhaps, the most important and valuable for him, the color theory course.The period when the artist worked at the Bauhaus was perhaps the most productive in his career. In 1926, Kandinsky wrote one of the most influential books in the history of modern art, “Point and Line to Plane”. His monumental, perfectly geometric \"Composition VIII\", which marked the dawn of a new phase in his artwork, was also painted there. And if in the beginning of this period the works of Kandinsky had been strongly influenced by the ideas of Suprematism and Constructivism, after moving to Dessau, his paintings had new romantic sounding and mood. \" “Angular Structure” is one of Kandinsky’s iconic paintings of those years. Peace and relaxation replaced strictly ordered compositions with a tense opposition of geometric forms. The compositions seem to have gained more air with the elements floating free."},{"paintingTitle":"Garden in Murnau II","artistName":"Wassily Kandinsky","artistContentId":189246,"paintingContentId":"3d504616-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1910, 67×51 cm • Oil, Cardboard","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1200/work/040/448242.jpg","paintingDescription":"At the end of 1904, Kandinsky, together with Gabrielle Munteris sent to a multi-year journey (mostly for European countries), which influenced his future work and determined the direction of later artistic experiments of the artist. During your journey Kandinsky several months he lived in Paris (the city itself he is not very liked, but they stayed there at the insistence Munter), where he became acquainted with the work Cezanneand the fauves. Their bright and energetic paintings has had a significant impact on the palette and colour saturation of the works that the artist began to create after his return to Germany. In the summer of 1909 Kandinsky and Munter go to a small town of Murnau in the foothills of the Bavarian Alps. This trip is considered a kind of starting point in the development of Kandinsky abstract artist. Picture \"The garden in Murnau\" Kandinsky was written just at this period. In the city they are from Gabriel came at the invitation of longtime friends and colleagues of the artist – Alexei Jawlenskyand Marianne Verevkin. Most of the time they spent together, often working EN plein air, so during this period, Kandinsky mostly paints landscapes (1, 2, 3, 4). But these landscapes quite unlike the early work of the artist, they still felt the influence of the Impressionists, but noticeable mood, which will feature his \"impressions\", \"improvisations\" and \"compositions\".Of these new landscapes painted in Murnau, gradually leaves the volume, changing the perspective. Kandinsky begins to use a more vibrant, dense color, but roll them very thin, sometimes almost transparent layer. \"The garden in Murnau\" along with other works of this period clearly demonstrates the gradual movement of Kandinsky towards the abstract. Here still quite distinguishable objects, but their outlines are already maximally blurred, and the borders are often very arbitrary. Their landscapes painted in Murnau, Kandinsky was later to say: \"I had no interest in trees or the house itself. Blending into the canvas of colored lines and spots, I wanted to make objects sing with the power that was known to me alone.\"Author: Eugene Sidelnikov"},{"paintingTitle":"The horseman in the Park of Saint-cloud","artistName":"Wassily Kandinsky","artistContentId":189246,"paintingContentId":"3d504617-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1906 • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1200/work/e09/174856.jpg","paintingDescription":"There is still no description of this artwork.

Despite the relatively short career of the painter, his shoulder is already a lot of achievements: published the book \"concerning the spiritual in art\", creation group \"Phalanx\", then a New artistic enterprises, and finally The \"blue rider\". In the two years prior to that, he writes the first fully abstract painting gradually completely abandoning figurative painting. And in 1912 in Berlin, held his first solo exhibition. And although \"impressions\", \"improvisations\" and \"compositions\" was hailed by critics pretty cool, the name Kandinsky from this point begins to sound around the world.Despite the recognition and popularity, the artist has not ceased to experiment, transform and perfect your technique. So in 1913, he writes \"Squares with concentric circles\" a kind of study of interaction of different colors and shapes. In a sense, this work prefigures the birth of the later post-war works by Kandinsky and symbolizes a transition from the emotional and chaotic early abstractions to strict geometrical \"bauhausstil\" period.Using the simplest forms of Kandinsky explores the impact of different colors on the viewer and the emotional response that these colors evoke. According to the artist, all the colors are able to exert a dual effect. The first is a simple physical impact on the viewer's eyes similar to the pleasant sensations, for example, from the delicious food. The second effect is much more profound, spiritual: this is what Kandinsky called \"soul vibration\", internal resonance caused by the touch of color directly to the inner essence of a person.Author: Eugene Sidelnikov"},{"paintingTitle":"Blue sky","artistName":"Wassily Kandinsky","artistContentId":189246,"paintingContentId":"3d504619-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1940, 100×73 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1200/work/8d0/297814.jpg","paintingDescription":"Scholar of Kandinsky Michel Conil-Lacoste wrote about the painting \"Blue sky\" so: \"Graphic strictness in this picture is inferior to the Baroque multiplicity of motives, they look like they have lost all touch with the structure that was decisive in space and has long been a clear and visible only to the artist, and his only duty was to make it visible for everyone else. Strange floating figures want to call creatures. The artist does nothing to mitigate this bizarre, grotesque effect. On the other hand, the more absurd these figures, the more obvious his desire to study them in minute detail, the more refined their shapes, the brighter color\".After closing Bauhaus in 1933, Kandinsky moved to Paris. Here he would reside until his death, since after the exhibition \"Degenerate art\" by the Nazis in 1937 and presented about 50 of his works, to return to Germany, the artist could not. In the last years of his life Kandinsky, according to many researchers, returns to figurative painting. However, it is very difficult to call itself in the traditional sense, rather as a kind of synthesis with abstract art. The artist's paintings are becoming a bit humorous, even playful tone. Kandinsky begins to inhabit his works of fancy \"biomorphic\" shapes, or flying, or floating on the surface of the canvas (1, 2, 3, 4). The picture Blue sky - the brightest representative of this period. Creatures, similar to both fish and birds and animals reminiscent of works Joan Miro at first glance randomly scattered on the blue background. But this is misleading, as Kandinsky still attaches great importance to the composition. The mystery of the nature of these creatures is increasing and due to the uncertainty of background: despite the title of the painting, it is impossible with complete certainty that we face is the sky, not the waves of the sea.Author: Eugene Sidelnikov"},{"paintingTitle":"A few laps","artistName":"Wassily Kandinsky","artistContentId":189246,"paintingContentId":"3d50461a-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1926, 140×140 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1000/work/095/287085.jpeg","paintingDescription":"After returning to Germany from Russia Kandinsky began to work in the famous The Bauhaus in Weimar. In 1926, the school moved to Dessau, and the artist began a new period became the most productive and rich. In the same year 1926, when it was written the painting \"Several circles\"Kandinsky is releasing a book \"Point and line to plane\" in which he sets out his views on painting in General and abstract art in particular. In this work the artist has organized his ideas about form and colour, their relations and interactions with each other, about the musical and emotional equivalent of different colors and their relationship with each other.Fruitful period in the work of Vasily Kandinsky lasted until 1933. During this time he wrote 159 oil paintings and 300 water colors. However, in the same year came to power, the Nazis closed the Bauhaus, and Kandinsky was forced to hastily move to Paris. An impressive part of the artist's works, written between 1926 and 1933, were destroyed.The painting \"Several circles\" is one of the few surviving works of that period – it is a perfect exercise in abstract style, while its flawless pattern. The forms here have a value-filled life, regardless of their relations with the external reality. It is a harmoniously-space painting was the culmination of all previous experiences with Kandinsky circles, laconic and at the same time infinitely profound visual display of the music of the heavenly spheres. The artist himself once gave a very poetic definition and description of this seemingly very simple form: \"Circle, which I often use in recent times, cannot be called otherwise but romantic. And today's romanticism is without a doubt much more deep, beautiful, meaningful and beneficial. This is a block of ice with a flaming fire inside.

It is interesting from this point of view in his early work, in which you can see the hints at how to radically change his style.Picture \"Two on a horse\" at first glance ordinary, it has a folklore and fairy-tale motifs and, perhaps, nostalgia. But on the other it shows how at the forefront of the artist gradually entering the lines and color spots. The faces of the people drawn are not clear, they relaxed and pensive pose speaks of samovlublennosti. Think, the rider holds the reins, and the horse carries them herself. Simple plot and plenty of space for the imagination: who are they, where are they going? In Medieval times the movement in the paintings \"right to left\" meant returning home. Perhaps that is why the figures on the canvas so calm.The picture is similar to the ancient mosaic with dark colors that are diluted more vivid colors. Dominated by blue color, which, according to Kandinsky, \"typical heavenly color, and in strong its deepening, develops an element of rest.\" The painting is full of romance and tenderness.

This work is a logical continuation of the Songs Vand VI all three paintings United by the theme of the Apocalypse. Elements of \"Composition VI\" - the Flood and the Resurrection are viewed in this work. Its main theme – the last judgment, but it is not seen as disaster but rather as a liberation, the world's transition from the material to the spiritual. Therefore, the \"Composition VII\" from other works of the series feature bright colors, \"flashing\" contrast lines.The composition of each work of Kandinsky is striving to build so that the viewer could \"enter\" inside the picture and rotate it. He weights the lower edge of the composition, thereby pushing it forward, and the upper part, on the contrary, facilitates, distancing her from the viewer. One of the main Kandinsky contrasts between blue and yellow flowers set in the center of the composition creates a zone of active movement into and out of.Kandinsky spent many months in preparation for the writing of \"Composition VII\", but the creation of the paintings took him only four days. The artist has made about 30 sketches to canvas (1, 2). Some of them remind of detailed sketches to paintings Caravaggioor Leonardo da Vinci depicting the folds of fabric, the leaves on the trees or human limbs. Some of the times just repeated the same curved line, on the other schematically shows the basic structural elements of the composition, and still others contain a detailed plan for the creation of the canvas. In addition there are about 15 different pictures related to \"Composition VII\": the oil sketches, pencil sketches, watercolors, paintings on glass and engraving.Gabrielle Munter, who was a witness to the creation of paintings, November 25, 1913, made in his diary entry about that in their house in Murnau delivered a canvas for \"Composition VII\", Kandinsky and the same evening I set to work. The next morning she took the first photograph of the painting, and after lunch the second. Journal entry Munter on November 28, says that the picture is complete.

His written collections of lectures, Writings on Form and Design Theory are considered as important to modern art as Leonardo da Vinci’s written works were to the Renaissance. As a child, Klee was mainly oriented as a musician, having played the violin since he was eight, but in his teen years, he found that art allowed him freedom to explore his style and express his radical ideas. Although Klee is now considered a master of color theory, he spent a long time in his search for his sense of color. At first, Klee drew in black and white, saying he would never be a painter. But as an adult, after a visit to Tunisia, in which he was impressed by the quality of light, he had found his sense of color and began experimenting with his newfound decision to be a painter. \r\n\r\nKlee spent much of his adult life teaching at various universities and art schools, including the German Bauhaus School of Art and Düsseldorf Academy. During his tenure at Düsseldorf, he was singled out as a Jew by the Nazi party. The Gestapo searched his home and he was fired from his job. Some of his later works were also seized by the Nazis. \r\n\r\nAlthough the artist was born in Switzerland, he was not born a Swiss citizen. His father was a German national, and citizenship being decided on paternity, Klee was born a German citizen. His request for Swiss citizenship was not granted until six days after his untimely death from undiagnosed scleroderma. Klee’s legacy includes over 9,000 works of art, which have inspired many other painting and musical compositions. In 1938 he was immortalized by Steinway Pianos in their “Paul Klee Series” pianos.

And hardly any of the paintings Klee got such a deep philosophical and cultural feedback from several of its holders. This is all the glue from one point on the canvas, he starts to live in a world that in the future no longer needed his leadership and imagination, and lives by himself, inland, incorporated in the laws. What happened next, Paul Klee would have liked.They say that Walter Benjamin, a German Jew and a philosopher, never parted with this watercolor that I bought from the artist in 1921, immediately after creation. After 12 years of daily contemplation, he wrote about this painting a mystical work \"Agesilaus Santander\" and will always keep it before our eyes as a key image for reflection and a guide in the spiritual quest. This Benjamin called the clawed-angel lapago Klee's Angel of history and in one of his main books describe his movement through the terrible and the powerful metaphor: \"Klee has a painting called Angelus Novus. It depicts an angel who looks like he is ready to part with something that stares. His eyes wide open, mouth rounded, and the wings straightened. Should look like the angel of history. His face turned to the past. Where for us the chain of upcoming events, where he sees a solid disaster continually gromozda the ruins over the ruins and it all falls down at his feet. He would have stayed to raise the dead and slap the debris. But a heavy wind rushing from heaven, fills his wings with such force that he no longer folded. The wind carries him irresistibly into the future to which he with his back turned, while the pile of debris before him rises to the sky. What we call progress is this storm\".After 1940, Walter Benjamin committed suicide in a small hotel, having been refused at the border and having lost all hope to emigrate from Nazi-occupied France, his Angelus Novus found another house, but it is still not known. The new owner of the painting became Benjamin's friend Theodor Adorno, and later his another friend, one of the most famous Jewish philosophers, the researcher of the Kabbalah and honorary doctor of many universities around the world Gershom Scholem. Until his death Salema in 1982, a whopping 62 years after its creation, the painting could not see almost no one, but she was known in advance. And while some critics and collectors rage in connection with undeserved fame, has fallen by Angelus Novus (say, the glory is not due to the artistic qualities of the picture, and the fictional), the work lived in the twentieth century a life which avant-garde artists in the 20 years I sincerely wanted.

It was important to promote even the most conventional and decorative image to metaphysical meanings. The name was his additional artistic technique. The disciples remembered that the written works can months to stand in the workshop of glue placed at the walls until they was Association, accurate emotions, until there was a flash right words – and then the name. Only after that the picture could be considered finished.Even when the glue invented his own pointillism – created the image in terms of how Sulfur and Signacand squares – there was no pure geometry. There was always something else: sounds, home, gardens, road. Musician Klee captured the architecture, in which he felt and heard the rhythm, he certainly could play the violin most beloved buildings. And that rhythm gives rise to this net, simply the technique of filling in the squares with different colors. In recognition of the glue, this method of art – another creative quest and puzzle, which he loved to have fun: \"...I was trying to achieve the most possible traffic with the least money (the savings obtained by the repetition of a limited number of simple structural units)\".The glue raskoldoval architecture, it is no longer frozen music – it moves and sings. The paintings of Klee is the feeling of the city, the feeling of the street. This is the categorical opposite of plein air painting, studying the subtleties of the landscape, it is the impression of movement through the street when not looking specifically at features of architecture, light or detail. You yourself are part of this urban landscape, you're the catcher of the light flux. And that's why I can look at everything from several points of view. For example, to see the house inside and outside, and the streets top and sides.All the early collectors of Klee, buying paintings from the artist slightly obsessed. What. And it is not surprising that Richard Doetsch-Benziger before you start to assemble glue, collecting old books. He must have felt in the artist chronicler of something terribly distant, whether past, or future. In 2011, the picture of the \"town's castle\" became the most expensive work of Klee sold at auction to a private collection.

His paintings, murals, and sketches are marked by a sensual eroticism, which is especially apparent in his pencil drawings. Klimt attended the Vienna University of Arts and Crafts in 1876, and formed the “Company of Artists” with his two brothers and a friend, after which he was awarded the Golden Order of Merit from the Emperor of Vienna. In 1892, his father and one of his brothers died, leaving him responsible for their families. The family tragedy also affected his artistic vision, which helped him develop his own personal style. \r\n\r\nThroughout his life, although he was a controversial painter due to his subject matter, he was made an honorary member of the Universities of Vienna and of Munich. He was also a founding member and president of the Vienna Secession, which sought to create a platform for new and unconventional artists, bring new artists to Vienna, and created a magazine to showcase its member’ work. \r\n\r\nKlimt lived a simple, cloistered life, in which he avoided other artists and café society. He often wore a long robe, sandals, and no undergarments. He also had many discreet affairs with women, and fathered at least 14 children. This may be an indication of his passion for women, their form and sexuality, which was the main focus of many of his works. The majority of his paintings were characterized by golden or colored swirling designs, spirals, and phallic shapes, depicting dominant women in erotic positions.  \r\n\r\nKlimt died in the influenza epidemic of 1918, leaving behind a posthumous legacy that few artists can rival.

Judith has always been a symbol of wisdom, courage and virtue prevailing over the evils of the wicked. However, in 1901, Gustav Klimt offered its own interpretation of this famous story and his own vision of the main subject. The word \"controversial\" can be applied almost to all masterpieces of the artist, and \"Judith and Holofernes\" painting is no exception.Klimt chose a famous \"golden\" Adele Bloch-Bauer as a model for this painting, and the recognizable traits of her face gave rise to a wave of rumors about an affair between the artist and his model. Characterized by frank sensuality, the Klimt painting was different if compared to the same scene depicted by Giorgione, Botticelli and Caravaggio. The ecstatic expression on the face of Judith, her tense fingers passionately clutching the severed head of Holofernes, and her shamelessly naked body shocked the residents of Vienna. In their understanding, this perky femme-fatal obviously enjoying the cold-blooded murder, could not be linked to the image of a virtuous widow who dared to sacrifice her virtue in order to save her city from the enemy army.The ambiguity of the canvas and overt sexuality of its subject confused the public so much... that it was decided to assume that it depicted not Judith, but the other well-known biblical personality – a cunning Salome with the head of John the Baptist. So for a long time, despite the name of the work written on the frame, it was known as \"Salome\". By the way, to distinguish Judith from Salome, the Old masters used to depict the former in a company of her maid, who helped the widow to get into the camp of the Assyrians and to carry out the murder of Holofernes.The portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer can probably be called the quintessence of the whole \"Golden period\" in Gustav Klimt`s artwork. In particular, it concerns the abundance of precious material the artist used in this work (Klimt decorated his paintings with real gold). However, the canvas does not look pretentious or tacky. Amazingly, but the abundance of gold does not create the sense of wealth and luxury, it seems only as a natural frame for a beautiful woman instead, with Judith`s face and hands highlighted in the picture. Gustav Klimt painted the portrait of Adele at the peak of his career using techniques and methods that allow determining the authorship of any of his mature works accurately. Here we can trace references to Egyptian and Byzantine art, a variety of ornaments skillfully interwoven into the composition and the clothing of the subject, and a subtle aura of sensuality surrounding the \"Golden Adele\"."},{"paintingTitle":"Kiss","artistName":"Gustav Klimt","artistContentId":191443,"paintingContentId":"3e1ae911-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1908, 180×180 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1000/work/0f2/303229.jpg","paintingDescription":"You can hardly find a painting as much cited and imitated on a variety of media, sometimes quite unexpected ones, as The Kiss. Cups, bookmarks, calendars and postcards, even kitchen utensils and bed linens. Anyone who has ever been to Vienna, hardly helped the desire to take a souvenir with the image of one of the most famous loving couples in the world.Gustav Klimt left Vienna very rarely. You can count his trips to Paris on the fingers of one hand. As for the rest of Europe, he seemed to have little interest in it. The only exception was Italy, or rather Ravenna, from where Klimt in 1903 brought his passionate Byzantine mosaics. The use of gold and a variety of ornamental patterns in the works of old masters were reflected in the most productive and bright \"Golden Period\" of Klimt’s work, in the mature period that gave the world his most famous paintings, including The Kiss.Ornaments used by the artist to depict the couple merged in a loving embrace, are not accidental. Throughout almost his whole creative career, Klimt tried to convey his vision of the duality of love. Here Gustav Klimt conveys this sensation, in particular, through the differentiation of male and female. The garment of the man in The Kiss is drawn with clear squares and rectangles, while the dress of his lover is decorated with ornamentation, in which the softer and \"female\" circles and spirals predominate.There are two more interesting details in The Kiss. First, as in most of his mature works, the artist does not allow the viewer to see the face of the character (Klimt was often blamed for the fact that he was only interested in women; after all, he completely stopped drawing men). And secondly, note that Klimt did not paint the kiss itself on the canvas, but rather its expectation, anticipation. According to one version, the painting was ordered to him by a certain count. He gave the artist a medallion with an image of his beloved and asked to portray them together. But during the work on the painting, Klimt fell in love with the girl from the medallion, quite suddenly for himself. And so instead of the count, Gustav Klimt pictured himself beside her, hiding his face. Therefore the couple on the canvas is not merged into a kiss, but remains in a passionate love longing, in agonizing expectation of the kiss.Author: Yevheniia Sidelnikova"},{"paintingTitle":"Afina Pallada","artistName":"Gustav Klimt","artistContentId":191443,"paintingContentId":"3e1ae912-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1898, 75×75 cm • Inlay, Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1200/work/0a3/226161.jpg","paintingDescription":"In 1889 in the Austrian capital hosted the first exhibition of the Vienna secession. Following the German colleagues of the Austrian artists seceded from the semi-official Home of artists and organized their own Union to be able to create and present works of art that go beyond the dominant conservative style. As the Munich secessionists, the Viennese artists made her a symbol of the patron Athena Pallas. And at the very first exhibition in Vienna President of the secession Gustav Klimt presented a picture depicting a warlike Greek goddess.Afina Pallada\" is very different from other female portraits by Klimt. Sophisticated, highly sensual, sexually fatal beauties have become the hallmark of the artist. In contrast, Athena exudes power and authority, it is full of militant magnetism. Her shiny helmet, a gold breastplate and amazing live, burning fire of the eyes became not only a symbol of the struggle of secessionists for freedom of expression (the canvas so impressed the critics that Athena began to call \"the demon of secession\"), but some choice in the works of Klimt. It is with this picture began a new stage in creativity of the artist who was called \"the Golden age\" and gave the world most famous paintings of Klimt, written in inimitable style.In Athena, which the secessionists chose as their patron, the artist was interested in the greater part of her divine essence, and not sexuality. This is not surprising, considering her sexual ambiguity in the Greek myths. The fact is that, despite the appearance belonging to the female sex, Athena is endowed with a mostly male qualities. According to some researchers, in this work Klimt alludes to the well-known theory about the close connection of the lust for power with sexual desire. Whatever it was, almost asexual goddess Pallas Athena was one of the strongest female images in the works of Klimt.Author: Eugene Sidelnikov"},{"paintingTitle":"Hygieia.

And in 1894 Klimt received another prestigious and large-scale order: he was to write three paintings which were to decorate the great ceiling of the Assembly hall of the main building of the University of Vienna.That order will be executed not quite so, as suggested by the University authorities, should have thought when Klimt became the leader of the Vienna secession and began to write controversial shit, shocking the audience with his candor. When in 1901, canvas \"Philosophy\", \"Medicine\" and \"Jurisprudence\" was presented at the secession exhibition, the artist's barrage of criticism. The paintings were called \"perverted\" and \"pornographic\". \"Medicine,\" which were supposed to represent the triumph of science in the victory over illness, was subjected to particularly vicious obstruction. The artist blamed on the fact that the canvas is absent any mention of medical science, and that it rather represents the victory of death over life. Complaints Klimt wrote 87 professors from different faculties of the University of Vienna, and then it came even before consideration in the Austrian Parliament. In 1905, weary from years of epic the artist returned from the Ministry of education the advance and soon sold the \"University series\" of private collectors.The paintings, unfortunately, suffered a tragic fate. After the German invasion of Austria by the Nazis appropriated many art objects, among them was and \"the University\" paintings by Klimt. In 1943 they were transported to storage in castle Immendorf, but in 1945, retreating under the onslaught of the allied army, the Nazis burned the castle together with the paintings. From them there are only a few preliminary sketches, and photos.Author: Eugene Sidelnikov"},{"paintingTitle":"Death and Life","artistName":"Gustav Klimt","artistContentId":191443,"paintingContentId":"3e1ae914-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1915, 178×198 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1000/work/2ba/536354.jpg","paintingDescription":"Unusual and fascinating paintings by famous Austrian artist Gustav Klimt attracted the attention of the audience not only bright colors and overt eroticism, but also for its deep symbolism. A vivid example is the Klimt painting \"Life and Death\", the description of which we offer you.By the end of the XIX century painter fully formed as a master with a private and recognizable style. Art historians call this phase of the art of Klimt, which began around 1898, gold. The artist actively uses the Golden color in his work, thoughtfully and thoroughly suited to the implementation of plans, carefully working through each element and getting the end result that delights even the pickiest of critics.\"Life and Death\" is an allegorical work, in which Gustav Klimt spent 8 years, from 1908 to 1916, It tells us about the eternal confrontation between life in all its manifestations and death waiting to happen at a distance. The whole composition consists of three conventional parts: on the left side the artist has placed the figure of Death, the right group of people, symbolizing Life. Dark space between the left and right part of the picture separates them from each other, as if holding the dark priest and not allowing him to get closer to the living.To contrast their characters Gustav Klimt uses both color and form: Life and Death in his painting recognizable at a glance. Right corner of the canvas shines with rainbow colors, shaded gold. In this kind of patchwork cocoon, symbolizing Life, the viewer sees the faces of peacefully sleeping children and mothers, peacefully clutching them to himself, figures of men and women embracing each other, and the old woman, lost in thought. The continuity of generations is what makes Life victorious in this eternal fight.Death on the Klimt painting \"Life and Death\" presents a lonely, slightly hunched figure, watching the celebration of Life. Her skeleton hidden under the shapeless robe, decorated with black crosses, circles, and rectangles of dark green and purple — the audience saw only the skull, which is slightly leaned forward, as if Death is looking at what is happening with interest and are not averse to take part in it. She knows that one day there will be her time and she will gradually take all — both young and old. But for now she could only wait, threateningly poised his deadly scepter.Today the Klimt painting \"Life and Death\" can be seen in the Leopold Museum in Vienna (Austria)."},{"paintingTitle":"Music","artistName":"Gustav Klimt","artistContentId":191443,"paintingContentId":"3e1ae915-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1895, 37×44.5 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy800/work/f36/303231.jpg","paintingDescription":"In 1892 Klimt's life happened two consecutive tragic events, which influence on his work and life in General. First died his father, and soon after that he died a brother of the painter Ernst. After his father's death on the shoulders of Klimt went completely to the welfare of the family, and brother's death inflicted a crushing blow to the artist. Ernst Gustav was not only a relative but also a colleague, and one of her closest friends. They are together since childhood, studied art, worked together and achieved great popularity in Vienna. After the death of his father and brother Klimt permanently depressed. During these years the chief support was Emilia Flege. And at the same time gradually begins to transform and change his work. The starting point can be considered a canvas \"Music\" written in 1895, and became to some extent a forerunner of the most famous works of the artist, which he will create during the \"Golden period\". The idea to portray in the painting the Music itself was pretty ambitious, but Klimt was already quite famous in Vienna by the artist to afford it. Besides, in the future, he will prove the critics it absolutely does not care.Klimt was passionate about antiquities and ancient art. This hobby has allowed him to create an especially bright, imaginative and executed with almost photographic precision the work adorning the walls of the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. But if the design Museum the focus was on Ancient Egypt, in the painting \"Music\" reigns Supreme Ellada. The main character of the fabric, very young girl, almost a child, holding a lyre – instrument, sung in ancient Greek art. In the right part the artist depicts the Sphinx, which, among other things, is a symbol of freedom of creativity and personality in General. This picture from the early works of Klimt is distinguished by the rejection of traditional perspective and classical subjects in favor of symbolism, pronounced and decorative characteristic of art Nouveau \"flatness, two-dimensionality of the image. But the artist is in no hurry to abandon the usual image of people, which gives the painting the similarity with a slightly blurry old picture.Author: Eugene Sidelnikov"},{"paintingTitle":"Naked truth","artistName":"Gustav Klimt","artistContentId":191443,"paintingContentId":"3e1ae916-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1899, 240×64.5 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1200/work/db3/226165.jpg","paintingDescription":"There is still no description of this artwork.

It has been just as popular and widespread as The Kiss, another famous picture by Klimt. Souvenir shops in Vienna teemed with a variety of items depicting this fatal beauty with her put up hair and languid heavy-lidded eyes. When Austria had to part with the painting, this event has become a nationwide tragedy. Many Austrians did not hold back their tears, when they watched The Woman In Gold leave to the USA. Intrigues and scandals accompanied the entire existence of this painting. In the very beginning, there was a story about revenge.A legend has it that Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer learned about his wife Adele and Gustav Klimt having an affair, so he asked Klimt to make her portrait. The insulted and humiliated man came up with an ideal plan of revenge against the unfaithful wife and her lover. He promised an enormous fee to the artist for the unique art work; in order to make it, Klimt would have to spend so much time with Adele that he would get sick of her. Bloch-Bauer heard about the numerous mistresses of the artist and about the fact that none of them stayed with Klimt for a long time. In essence, Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer has been a profitable investment, as well as an excellent way to take revenge on his wife, who was forced to watch her lover losing his passion with every passing day.   After the German invasion to Austria in 1938, Nazis captured almost all the property of the Bloch-Bauer family. During the World War II, the Adele's portrait was concealed from the public because of the apparent Jewish origin of the model; after the war, it took its place in the Belvedere Gallery. The only surviving representative of the Bloch-Bauer family, the niece of Ferdinand and Adele, Maria Altman, who escaped Nazi persecution and became a US citizen, only learned in 1998 that she was the owner of the portrait by uncle's will. That was the beginning of the 8-year legal wrangling, which caused an international scandal. However, Maria Altman eventually managed to regain both The Woman In Gold, and other paintings by Klimt, bequeathed by Ferdinand. In the spring of 2015, a movie The Woman in Gold with Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds starring appeared on the screens. It relates the struggle of Maria Altman and her lawyer against the Austrian authorities.

The skills and talent of ambitious novice artists did not go unnoticed, and soon the orders became so many that the Trinity had to withdraw from the study. The quality of work does not hurt, the brothers Klimt and the Match was constantly improved in the business through day-to-day practice. This is evidenced by the fact that in just four years the \"Company of artists\" became the most popular team in Vienna. In addition, they took orders from other cities and even from abroad.In 1886 the \"Company of artists\" fulfilled the order for registration of the staircase in the new Royal theatre in Vienna. Here Klimt and his colleagues depicted a production of \"Romeo and Juliet\" at London's globe theatre of Shakespeare's time. The audience was delighted with the work, in particular, from the masterfully written those characters (by the way, among spectators Klimt portrayed himself and his colleagues in appropriate costumes). For this almost photographic accuracy is to thank the teachers of art school, who encouraged the young artists to spend long hours copying photos. For this work, \"Company of artists\" received a prize from the Austrian Emperor.And soon after, Klimt received the new prestige order, again on a theatrical theme: the artist had to represent the audience during a performance in the old Royal theatre. When the news about the future of canvas spread among the Viennese high society, the artist has lined up a whole queue of people wanting to depict them in the painting. According to critics, before you take the painting \"the Old Royal theater Klimt did about a thousand sketches. To work the artist used a mixture of matte paints, honey and gum, which is the Foundation of gouache. The artist has depicted about 150 people, most of whom were real prototypes.

As a child, his father was a judge, who wanted him to pursue a career in law, but his uncle, recognizing little Edouard’s talents, encouraged his interest in art, often taking him the Louvre. It was not until Manet failed two entrance exams into the French Navy that his father relented to his son’s wishes and allowed him to start art lessons under the academic painter Thomas Couture, who had him copy the works of the great masters in the Louvre. The young artist was also influenced by Frans Hals, Diego Velazquez, and Francisco Goya. \r\n\r\nIn 1856, in his early thirties, Manet opened his own studio. He began painting in a quasi-realist style, which transitioned to a more Impressionist style when he met the painter Berthe Morisot, who exposed him to her circle of Impressionist painter friends, including Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Edgar Degas, and their plein air painting techniques. Many of Manet’s works revolved around depictions of leisure activities, including observations of social life in all of the classes, from bourgeois horse racing to prostitutes drinking, to the streets of Paris and boating scenes, many of which were made from sketches done on the spot. \r\n\r\nAlthough his work was Impressionistic, he resisted involvement with any specific style of painting, and thus preferred to present his works to the Salon of Paris rather than the many Impressionist Exhibitions. In 1875, some of his paintings were included in a book-length edition of Edgar Allen Poe’s The Raven and in 1881, he was awarded the Legion of Honor by the French government. Manet died eleven days after the amputation of his left foot due to gangrene, from complications of syphilis and rheumatism, which had been so bad as to cause partial paralysis in the years leading up to his death.

The cat is outrageous, the embodiment variation, lust, witch nature, and, finally, wickedness, she stood at the feet of the Nude Olympia and hissed at the audience. The picture was taken in the Salon in 1874, the same year when in the Studio of the photographer Nadar took the first impressionist exhibition. In \"the railroad\" everything was decent and nothing is forced down the viewer with godly thoughts. But Manet was laughing again.

In any workshop of any painter of the nineteenth century could no longer receive such or even anything like a similar picture. While the Interior has conquered \"The Romans era of decline\" and endless Venus and odalisques, she turned the painting, for it was not at that time any of the terms or traditions, in which it would be possible to write. And everything was to this effect worse.The jury of the French Salon, never distinguished favor to the young artists, in 1863, was particularly merciless. So much so that even Napoleon III was dissatisfied with the number not admitted to the exhibition works. Then the Emperor decided to throw in the same building simultaneously with the official Salon, the Salon of the rejected. Perhaps there was a pattern in the framework of the official exhibition, it would not have become the first in the history of modern art with canvas, over which crowds of spectators laughed and shyly whispered. Manet has become the most discussed artist of Paris, however, he wanted a completely different fame.The picture, originally called \"skinny\" was conceived as an artistic dialogue and a rethinking of several masterpieces: \"The rural concert\" Giorgione and \"The Judgment Of Paris\" Raphael. First inspired Manet to write two naked women next to clothed men, and the second to place the figure in space. Only women mane – not a nymph and not a goddess.Most of the ridicule caused the figure of a woman, who tries the water. It was said that she washed, and added in a whisper: you know, after which it is washed. In the picture I saw a scene of a sexual nature, and sitting a girl – a prostitute: too straight and defiant in her. The thing about painting furiously hissed: \"obscenity\", \"vulgarity\", the \"ugliness\".When crowds of spectators and critics puzzled alone managed to restrain his Holy wrath, it came to the artistic features of the painting. And, it was here that Manet made still more inexcusable liberties than in the choice of subject. It is absolutely unforgivable did with the term – the figure of a woman in the background is too large, each of the characters in the story as if is closer to the viewer than would be possible in reality. Later art critics say \"involved spectator,\" and the experimenters of the new generation will repeat this trick with cowering at the prospect. In 1863, a picture declared \"ridiculous\", and the artist – Amateur \"dauber\".

Gustave Courbet compare the figure of Olympia with the Queen of spades from a deck of cards in the morgue, and criticism genuinely is not advised for pregnant women and young girls to see this picture. If several strong guards are not put in front of the painting, an angry public, it would be definitely destroyed. A few days away from sin hung this filth higher, so no one got, and it was difficult to discern. It so happened one of the most violent scandals marked the beginning of modern art.Mane in horror, he suppressed and destroyed. No wonder he was worried, no wonder he was afraid of his Olympia and hid it in the far corner of the shop, for fear of the show and without that offended critics of his new film. As always, he didn't mean to shock and make revolutions in the history of painting of the 19th century there is hardly an artist, as a failure who sought to obtain official recognition. And this time, he again failed.The sharp word \"indecency\" and clinging to Edouard Manet since the Salon two years ago when he introduced \"Breakfast on the grass\" now become his constant companion. And yet what so shocked and insulted looks respectable French? No nudity, of course. It is enough in the world of painting.Edouard Manet wonders: \"I only wrote what I saw\". But the audience refused to see what I saw man: confident, outgoing, attractive and sensual goddess courtesan, whose nakedness the artist didn't even bother to cover up the mythological story. He call the picture \"Venus\", the degree of perturbation may be diminished. But all this bullshit with the choice of names and subjects Manet was not taken seriously – much more interested in the scenic possibilities of the conceived picture. The name \"Olympia\" comes from someone from friends. Well, Olympia, Olympia.But this name caused certain \"obscene\" Association. Such exotic and vespinae the names of loved to choose a expensive prostitutes. Besides, Olympia was named one of the most famous courtesans in history – the mistress of Pope innocent X, which is actually 10 years was ruled by the Catholic Church. And finally, it took less than 20 years since then, as in France, was published the novel of Alexander Dumas the younger. One of the heroines of the courtesans it was also named Olympia.No doubt the occupation of the heroine remains. Even if you do not go into the interpretation of the symbols like mules on the feet of Olympia or orchids in her hair. Even if you forget that dog, the symbol of marital happiness and fidelity, lying at the feet of the prototype Olympia, Venus Of Urbino By Titian, Manet replaced wayward cat. This hissing kitten mane got not less than a bold, defiant air of Olympia, too independent and outspoken.When, after the death of Manet, the artists under the leadership of Claude Monet collected 20 thousand francs, did not allow emigration Olympia overseas, bought it and donated it to the Louvre Museum, officials from the art took such a gift without enthusiasm. \"Olympia\" was again put away for another 17 years – now in the vaults of the Luxembourg Museum. It was written 50 years before its time.

Cost Bertha to be close, he grabbed the brush and was passionately caught her gestures, eyes, the indescribable fire in the dark eyes, which seemed to be burning only for him. She breathed life into his canvas.When the mother Berthe Morisot saw depicted in the painting \"Balcony\" brunette with dark eyes, she asked in astonishment mane: \"Are you sure my daughter?\" Yes, it was she, one of the most prominent women artists of the XIX century, the most daring and impressionistic of all the French Impressionists. But he saw in this young, silent, concentrated, a brilliant artist, which is not seen by others. Love.Everything was confusing and difficult in that relationship. Manet was married, and Morisot was not one of those women that give birth short, light affair. When Burt introduced me to scandalous, disgraced and the most discussed artist in Paris, she is under constant care of her mother made copies of old masterpieces in the Louvre. But like all young, hot, advanced, admired Manet. Platonic, painful, unspoken the affair lasted for 6 years. In 1869 the \"Balcony\" will be accepted at the Salon. After previous controversial appearances mane at the official exhibitions, this time criticism must be, in unison a sigh of relief: the picture at least all dressed up. But this does not mean that art Manet to accept and understand. Cursed rich, \"unnatural\" colors green fence of the balcony and shutters, bright blue tie, were perplexed over the dramatic experiments, in which again hit the artist. Here Manet realized one of the innovative and unusual for academic art ideas: it creates volume in the composition is not due to the location of the figures in the future, and with the help of artistic techniques. As for the photographic picture, it brings focus to only one figure, and the other blurs and deep in shade as the distance from the foreground. This one piece, the focus is of course Bertha.Edouard Manet considered the plot secondary thing, he sought feelings and impressions to pass exclusively the language of painting, so often the basis for his new paintings is without a doubt took the motives, invented by the great artists of the past. In \"the Balcony\", he rather freely reinterpreted the canvas Goya \"Mahi on the balcony\" but if gajewska embodiment, both of the female figure are equal, then the mane gives the feeling that his picture is only one main character.Edouard wrote 11 of the paintings to Bertha Morisot (1, 2, 3), all these years she has been a frequent visitor in his workshop. The artist became obsessed with the model eagerly drank his admiration – these sessions gave both the feeling of absolute closeness and possession. The last of the 11 paintings of Manet gave sweetheart on the eve of her wedding. 33-year-old Berthe married Manet's brother eugène.

During the Franco-Prussian war, for example, he remains besieged in Paris, volunteered to protect him and in the evenings, hungry, sick and exhausted, grieved news of the deaths of friends, bored, being separated from his wife and leads a fierce debate with Edgar Degas. Converge in the result that do not forgive Zola fleeing from Paris, put up.But it will be in 1870, when the war put an end to the reign of Napoleon III, Edouard Manet driven to a nervous breakdown. But for a few years before that discontent Manet-French government of the Emperor will break in only one tense, politically-charged painting. \"The execution of Emperor Maximilian\" was doomed – such a picture will not send to the Salon and even did not show on his own show. It was banned and until the death of Manet canvas saw no one, except close friends of the artist.We can not do without history. \"Execution\" is a quick, saucy and very specific reaction to one of the most shameful campaigns of Napoleon III: the vain of the conquest of Mexico, political revolution, and the shameful flight of the French army from this overseas country. Napoleon wanted to crank out something like the Egyptian campaigns of his famous kinsman, and at the same time to get closer to America. The French army overthrew the local ruler of Mexico and put here to rule a puppet of Napoleon III, the Emperor Maximilian. All anything, the story is not original and not new, but only the French for a long time is not enough to maintain an army in Mexico was expensive and completely illogical. The army returned home, and the Emperor Maximilian was left to deal with the Mexicans. When the Mexicans shot the intruder Maximilian and the French newspaper reported, Edouard Manet conceived a new picture, his only masterpiece based on a historic event. A passionate scholar of Manet and one of the best modern British art critics Waldemar Januszczak says: \"In the history of modern art there are only two paintings, which with sufficient force and effect depicted the events of his time: \"Guernica\" Picasso and \"Execution\" Manet\". Manet has managed not just to tell about the event and involve the viewer.Blank gray wall in the background of Manet will build only in the third version of the film (on the first versions of sketches for firing a group of stretched a dry, laconic landscape), soldiers also used to be dressed in a sombrero quite like the Mexicans. Then the soldiers disguised in French uniforms, Manet will challenge and accused the French of complicity, and the French Emperor – with murder. That his features had to identify his contemporaries in the face of the soldier who prepares the gun for the final shot. He, Napoleon III, Maximilian killer.But apart from the onlookers watching from behind the fence for the penalty, in the picture there is another observer, who was there and did nothing to stop it. It's you. That you cast a shadow in the bottom of the painting and quietly watching the execution of Emperor Maximilian.

But even these honors did Manet understandable for contemporaries. The artist stayed only a year, he suffered from excruciating pain, were exhausting treatment and was not able to work, portraits and still lifes are increasingly painted with pastels, throwing started work and not been able to return to them for several months.In this state, Manet wrote his most mysterious painting, a new interpretation of which offer art-critics so far – \"Bar \"Folies-Bergere\". Manet rarely requires narrative and symbolic interpretation of images – many elements in his paintings appeared only because it was required of the picturesque the law works. Manet often played with textures and colors, and not telling stories. But not in this picture.The space created by Manet in this painting, the perfect illusion, the unreality of which, you start to realize only when you look into the deliberate inconsistencies. St. Petersburg art critic Ilya Doronchenkov offers to start a list of the mysteries of the paintings directly from the genre. Portrait? Similar, but too complicated for a portrait, though it depicts a particular person – the bartender Susann, which regulars \"Folies bergère\" is well known. For domestic scenes here, too, too many mysteries-reflections: a mirror to the crowd, bottles reflected in the mirror in the wrong order, a reflection of men, which logically stand that we, the audience. Hold on tight, we are in the air! In the mirror it shows.All these optical illusion cause the glance to catch on and move on – look for discrepancies psychological. Attractive girl behind the bar is a marketing ploy similar places of entertainment. She needs to stop passing and get him to buy a glass of champagne, but she looks through us, it is detached and disengaged from what is happening. But in the mirror she is the same, but with completely different shapes shapes, more dense and rounded, behaves as it should, or the way I behaved a moment ago – he leans to the man. Social critics looking for in her way the similarity with the product, which is sold as well as drinks at the bar and in her sadness find the reaction to this situation. Classic art history sees the position of her hands analogy with the ancient images of the mother of God and Christ. But no supposition is not confirmed by the artist himself and is not obvious. He appeals to the activity of the spectator gaze, not giving answers to our questions. Mane 20 years only those involved that changes the viewer's eyes, raises in them a new perception of the painting. And at the end of life, the artist creates a work, which will start the new process in relations between the Creator and the viewer – the joint work and the creation of meaning.

By the time Manet already has earned the reputation as an upstart who is trying to attract off any price. And this time he not left the critics without bread. Jules-Antoine Castagnary was indignant: \"In \"Breakfast,\" for example, I see on the table, served with coffee, half a peeled lemon and oysters, which should not be there. Why then are they there? I know why. Because Manet has a weakness to the color stains, because he copes admirably with the writing of still-lifes and tend to write them wherever possible. And just as Manet combines the subjects of still life, solely for the sake of visual pleasure, as well he has a haphazard and characters...\" Another critic tried to satisfy his professional penchant for genre identification and to fit both pictures in the scenic tradition. Certainly, he had a system failure and did not remain anything else how witty joke: \"Manet has created a portrait of the balcony and the portrait of the Breakfast\".Before Manet did not write. Still life is just a lemon and a vase, portrait of man, looking directly at the viewer, genre scene – people making something understandable together and gives the viewer a chance to determine what's really going on here. From Manet nothing is clear, moreover, that the yellow colour of lemon peel masterfully supports the yellow straw hats of the Central character.The picture was painted in Boulogne-sur-Mer, on the shores of the English channel, where Manet rented a Villa for a family summer holiday. And for the main character of \"Breakfast\" he posed, Leon Leenhoff, a boy who was either the son or brother of Manet, which does not give sleep to art historians for over a hundred years. They say that Manet is not as simple as it seems. It was assumed that the two figures in the background of Manet by himself and his wife, Susanna, and that this family scene reveals the mystery of the birth of Leon. It was then established that the woman actually workers and Smoking male, whose shape is defiantly circumcised in the spirit of Japanese prints, artist's friend.Art historian Ilya Doronchenkov talks about Manet as \"brilliant optical apparatus\" in connection with this pattern and rejects all attempts to discern in her the secret signs family mysteries: \"In the painting \"Breakfast in the Studio\" – absolutely inconceivable for a Frenchman of his social level, the combination of red wine, coffee, oysters and lemon. The simple answer Mans first and foremost a painter. He is interested above all the mixture of colors and textures, and a logical pairing of objects and people matters\".Henri Matisse I saw the painting \"Breakfast in the Studio\" only once, in the gallery of brothers Bernheim, and wrote about it 35 years later.

One can count them on one hand. “The Bar” canvas probably is one of the most precious and significant among them. The main Russian collectors Sergei Shchukin and Ivan Morozov have got interested in the French art when Edouard Manet was already dead. After the death of the artist, all his paintings were auctioned off at the Hôtel Drouot and spread to private collections and galleries of art-dealers. Some of them were bought back by Monet’s wife and son, others – by old admirers and friends. When Russian collectors got to the French art, Manet has already become a classic. His “Olympia” and “The Luncheon on the Grass” prepared to move to the Louvre.«The Bar» is one of the late bold paintings of café scenes executed by Manet a la prima from real life. It’s a study for an unmaterialized painting. It’s a brilliant sketch made in thick long brushstrokes requiring no further processing which demonstrates a new manner of Manet. He was still dreaming about the Salon and The Legion of Honour but he has already felt that he should not sacrifice his way of seeing. In 1878, he was watching customers at café chantants, cabarets, and bars at the bottom of the Montmartre hill. There were bored prostitutes waiting for their clients, tired men watching the scene dancers from their tables, pensive women forgetting about their smoldering cigarettes, and waiters carrying beer glasses (by the way, it was a recent novelty in Paris approved only by a few places at the time).Art critics provided a tart response to Manet work. They said he was very good with still lifes and that was the reason why he put them at every opportunity, without rhyme or reason everywhere – in genre scenes and portraits, with no concern for culinary fineness and combination of products. All he’s ever cared about was how these elements matched in color and how the light hit the glass. And, yes, he was doing increasingly better with his still lifes, even if they composed of a pair of bottles and they, in their turn, were made of a pair of shades of the same color. A glass executed in five brushstrokes in the foreground of “The Bar” standing in front of a man that bents over, is much more daring than Renoir’s glasses in the “Luncheon of the Boating Party” and Degas’ glass in the “Absinthe”.Manet uses a tree trunk to cut the composition of “The Bar” from top to bottom in a very Japanese style. Inspired by the Ukyo-e woodcut prints, the same trick was used by Degas in his horserace paintings to make an effect of an image captured accidentally, like a momentary shot. However, Manet uses the spatial distortion and frontal impact for another purpose: he brings the viewer closer to the man sitting at the table and literally pulls us into the space of the canvas. In three years Manet would get the medal from the Salon, and with it, he obtained the long-awaited right to show his paintings at the main exhibition of Paris hors concours. At that moment, the artist who has changed the French art of the late 19th century and the art of the Salon, turned almost 50 years old.Author: Anna Sidelnikova"},{"paintingTitle":"Carnations and clematis in a crystal vase","artistName":"Edouard Manet","artistContentId":191982,"paintingContentId":"3e848060-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1882, 56×35.5 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1200/work/534/151882.jpg","paintingDescription":"There is still no description of this artwork.

After the opening of another Salon to mana began to approach friends and to praise two of his Marina. What Marina? He was not sent to the Salon no Marin! It turns out that some young lout uses the similarity of the names to become famous, not only – and even his paintings have more success. Over time, grievances and complaints disappeared in a huge mutual respect and admiration. In the summer of 1874, the artists worked together on the banks of the Seine, in Arzhanteye – like mane and decided to play with their friends in their impressionism. But by their rules. All impressionistic findings this summer he has tried and mastered: short jerky strokes, light palette, plein air, and sunlight. And still remained himself. He wrote the water and landscapes the Claude Monet working in a floating Studio boat but always found something that interested him always: the relationship between men and women and the internal laws of scenic works, which do not always coincide with the regularities of natural colors.So there was a mysterious Mediterranean blue of the Seine in the picture \"Argenteuil\" for which Manet frantically denounced critics demanding the validity of it, and that was another attempt of the artist to train the eye of spectators on a new look for sincere, emotional art. \"The artist can Express with the help of fruits and flowers or some clouds\"- says mane. And this time, he had the blue of the Seine to create the joyful mood in which he was staying that summer in which there were couples around him, slowly floating down the river and laughing loudly. When at the Salon of 1874, who timidly tried to praise the painting of Manet, he always shouted in response: \"But that blue!\" \"River Indigo, dense as metal, as straight as a wall\"- bogged down in the resentment of criticism. They were interested in only one defiant blue river. This mane just mocks and laughs at them, purposely arranges the hype and fanning the scandals around his name.\"My ambition is never to repeat tomorrow what I did yesterday\"- said mana. And after this summer he'll never write a blue Seine, but I'll write \"Spring\" sold in 2014 for $ 65 million and \"Bar \"Folies-Bergere\"and \"In the greenhouse\" never repeating themselves yesterday.Author: Anna Sidelnikova"},{"paintingTitle":"In the greenhouse","artistName":"Edouard Manet","artistContentId":191982,"paintingContentId":"3e848062-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1879, 150×115 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy800/work/09c/257487.jpg","paintingDescription":"There is still no description of this artwork.

Known for his use of color, his work is regarded as responsible for laying the foundation for modern plastic arts, along with the work of Pablo Picasso and Marcel Duchamp. At the age of 18, he went to study law, working as a court administrator. But, after a bout of appendicitis, during which his mother gave him paints and an easel to pass the time, he began drawing, soon leaving law school to pursue his art career, to the dismay of his father. \r\n\r\nHe was exposed to the works of Van Gogh, who was practically unknown at the time, in 1897 and 1898, when he visited his friend, painter John Peter Russell, in the island of Belle Ile, which totally changed his painting style. A lover of all art, he immersed himself in the work of his fellow painters, and often got himself into debt buying the work of other artists. He received much inspiration from the work of other artists as well, drawing inspiration from such varied sources as Japanese art, Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, and Pointillism. \r\n\r\nHis work, characterized as “fauvre,” or wild, often met with harsh criticism, which made it hard for him to provide for his wife and children. Due to vehement hatred of his works, his Blue Nude was burned in 1913 at an Armory Exhibition in Chicago. Although he had harsh critics, he had loving followers, including Gertrude Stein and her family. Throughout the years of 1907-1911, his friends organized and financed an art school, Academie Matisse, in which Matisse could instruct young artists. \r\n\r\nIn his later life, Matisse, who was partially reliant on a wheelchair, continued his artistic endeavors in creating cut paper collages, and working as a graphic artist. He also published Jazz in 1947, a collection of his printed and written works. Before his death of a heart attack, he established a museum of his own works,  which has helped establish his legacy as a leading figure in the modern art movement.

The models, including both professional sitters and the artist's acquaintances, distinguished themselves by their self-confidence, a direct look, devoid of coquetry, and expressive facial features (1, 2, 3). Perhaps, they looked this way because just at that time Matisse was in a relationship with the artist Olga Meerson: her appearance and character corresponded to all these qualities.The picture Spanish Woman With a Tambourine belongs to this series. In addition to the fact that it embodies a collective image of all the female qualities that the artist had always appreciated and preferred to find in his models, this is another portrait with a bright exotic flavor. By the time of its creation, Matisse had not yet had a chance to visit Spain (it happened a little later, in 1910), and the girl in the picture was not from this country.According to some information, she was a Gypsy, and the other – an Italian. Matisse sought to achieve the resemblance to the nationality stated in the title of the canvas with the help of a characteristic costume, consisting of a mottled blouse, a cropped jacket with embroidery and a red skirt. The traditional hairstyle and spirited pose of the model are the final accents of the expressive Spanish image. A burning shade of black and sharp color contrasts also emphasize it.The distinct dark contour of the pictures of that period often made them look strange and even aggressive to the public. For example, Girl with A Black Cat (Portrait of Matisse's daughter) really horrified the guests of the collector Sarah Stein, who bought the canvas. And The Girl with Green Eyes aroused resentment of the public at the exhibition in Paris in 1910, and in London, at the end of the same year. Although The Girl with Tulips is sitting, modestly crossing hands on her lap, she seemed insane to the visitors of Shchukin's house in Moscow.Nevertheless, the Russian collector bought out the Spanish Woman With a Tambourine as soon as it appeared in the Paris art gallery Bernheim-Jeune. Before leaving for Moscow, Spanish Woman was exhibited at the spring Salon des Independants (of the independent) in 1909. And on arrival in Russia, it became part of the ensemble of the famous Pink Drawing Room in Shchukin's house."},{"paintingTitle":"Dance (II)","artistName":"Henri Matisse","artistContentId":213888,"paintingContentId":"3eea9521-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1910, 391×260 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy800/work/8fe/449398.jpg","paintingDescription":"In 1908, Russian collector Sergey Shchukin commissioned Henri Matisse three large panels to represent dance, music and swimming. The latter has not been executed, but \"Music\" and especially “The Dance” was a declaration of the genius of Henri Matisse. Shchukin planned to decorate the hall of his Moscow mansion with these paintings. To Matisse it became the first major commission, so could finally say goodbye to the lack of funds. A source of inspiration for Henri Matisse was the performance of Isadora Duncan, who broke with the official ballet school and filled dance with passion, emotion and fury. Matisse`s visit to the cabaret \"Moulin de La Galette\" with Farandole (Provençal folk dance) on stage, also contributed to the creation of the panel. Matisse rejected the vagueness of the Impressionists. Here is how he described his work on the paintings for Shchukin: \"We are committed to clarity, simplifying ideas. Integrity is our only ideal... We are talking about how to learn and, perhaps, to learn to paint in lines anew\".Technical means were kept to a minimum in this work, Henri Matisse was extremely laconic: the azure sky, emerald green of the hill, the flaming bodies. The human figures are generalized, we can paraphrase the artist`s famous quote \"I do not paint women, I paint pictures\" to see that Matisse does not paint the dancers here, he paints the dance. The naked bodies have something primitive and pristine in them. The dance appears as a grand pattern of existence, it overlapped the canvas to become an archetype, the myth of the dance. In front of us circling. With their hands linked, the five figures are rotating in a frenzied dance. They form a vicious circle charged with energy that is, seemingly, about to spark the canvas.The paintings were exhibited at the Salon in 1911 and caused a stir. Furious and passionate nudity of the dancers, whose bodies merged in the ecstasy of dance, angered fans of classical beauties reclining on the sofas surrounded by the chubby putti. Nudity was not unusual, but the picture had more than just bodies in it: pure ecstasy, passion and sex splashed on the audience from this three-color painting with dancing figures. Shchukin had to ask Matisse to paint over some \"shame\". However. It could not hold back the emotional and sensual intensity of the painting. A thrilling, exciting and alluring \"Dance\" by Henri Matisse was to be placed on the ground floor of Shchukin`s Moscow mansion. \"Music\" was supposed to balance the mood of the guest on the second floor with its calm, meditative, self-absorbed vibes. The same three colors, the same five figures are depicted no longer on the hill, but on the plain, they do not merge, but appear as individual characters, absorbed into themselves and the music. On the third floor, the collector wanted to put the panel depicting leisure, swimming and relaxing.Matisse executed another version of “the Dance”, now located in New York Museum of modern art (MOMA). Raymond Eskola believed that in his second version of “The Dance” Matisse has surpassed the sensuality and Bacchante motives of the first version. However, most researchers agree that it is a sketch to the painting that was nationalized after the revolution and transferred to the Hermitage where it is kept today. Matisse created another panel on the subject for the Barnes Foundation. It was 13 meters, and Matisse used the technique of decoupage there."},{"paintingTitle":"Woman in hat","artistName":"Henri Matisse","artistContentId":213888,"paintingContentId":"3eea9522-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1905, 24×31 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1200/work/5e9/169481.jpg","paintingDescription":"From the picture \"Woman in hat\" began the famous Matisse. It can be considered the turning point: the artist finally said goodbye to the proclaimed neo-impressionism and Fauvism – art bright colors, bold decisions and decoration. Matisse had exhibited it at the salon d'automne in 1905. Poor public just put up with the antics of the Impressionists, and again, everything changed! The President of the Autumn salon Francis Jourdain held the position of \"I, of course, the man progressive, but the measure need to know\", so just in case, insisted on the rejection of the picture. Into open conflict with the academic Jourdain was not, though sympathetic to new research... About the portrait he said that Matisse here \"too modern\". When the jury in spite of his \"antiprotection\" took the painting to the exhibition, Jourdain exclaimed: \"Poor Matisse! I thought he's got all his friends.\"In the portrait of Matisse portrayed his wife Amelie. Bold, hitherto unseen combination of colors forms a wonderful harmony and makes it clear why this area was called Fauvism (les fauves - wild). Warm cinnabar, Carmine, madder balanced with icy emerald green, purple, cobalt. Unless the woman can bytt? But the color of Matisse is always a color changed, it's not the color of life, the color of the painting, which confirms his famous statement: \"I am not a woman, I create a picture\".It is interesting to analyze the influence of van Gogh on the paintings of Matisse. \"Vangogovskie\" fury and impulsivenessMatisse was attracted and repelled. His path lay in another direction – not rampant following the pulse, but not to suppress it in favor of rationality, and a kind of \"education\", by definition Askole (in any case not to be confused with didacticism – is Matisse on canvas is not allowed ever). Passion, passed through inner discipline, does not cease to be passion, but by Matisse gains depth and subtlety.Writer Francis Cork said relatively avant-garde movements \"Woman in hat\" immediately explained to him more \"than all these paradoxes,\" that is, numerous manifestos and theories of the time. The picture has caused a storm of mostly negative public reaction, but the American writer Gertrude Stein wished to buy it. She appealed to the administrator of the exhibition, he said that the picture of the set price of 500 francs, but, as a rule, the price is the possibility of concessions, and therefore he would recommend the Madame to offer 400 francs. Gertrude did. Imagine her surprise, when she handed over the refusal of the artist to reduce the cost of painting! The fact that Matisse then needed. When they brought a note from the Secretary of the Interior, reporting the buyer is willing to pay for a picture of 400 francs, Matisse was very happy. Amelie also insisted on the rejection, stating that if the buyer is so interested in the painting that wants to buy it, the difference 100 francs will not be significant. But for that money you will buy winter clothes for Margot (illegitimate daughter of Matisse, who lived in the family). Oh, and a rough few days had to endure Madame Matisse! The buyer was no news, and if something went wrong in the Affairs of the picturesque, the liking Matisse was cool. But three days later, Salon reported that the painting bought for 500 francs. Personal acquaintance with Matisse Gertrude Stein brought later.

From around this time, the artist has recurrently chosen goldfish as a subject in his art work. He has made about 9 paintings as well as drawings and prints featuring these tiny creatures. It was in his style to revise one subject over and over again, thus pushing his art further.Henri Matisse is considered to be the 20th century’s most important French painter. He used color as a homogeneous, primary substance, while complementing it with brilliant draughtsmanship. The artist was initially labelled as a leader of Fauvism – the art style developed in France in contrast to the dark disturbing Symbolist art of the fin de siècle, or turn of the century. The Fauves produced bright, emotional paintings with strong colors, simple shapes, and fierce brushwork. When the French art critic Louis Vauxcelles saw the work of Henri Matisse and André Derain at the Salon d’Automne in Paris in 1905, he named them les fauves (French ‘the wild beasts’). The contrast to traditional art was so striking that the name Fauvists has stuck with them for good.By 1908-1910, most of the main artists in the Fauvism group had moved away from the expressive emotionalism, except for Matisse. He continued to use the distinctive fauvist traits of bright emotive colors, plain shapes and painterly mark-making throughout his career. His Goldfish, 1912 is a bright example of his distinguished art style.\r\nColor\r\nThe goldfish immediately catches our attention due to their color. The bright scarlet strongly contrasts with more subtle pinks and greens that surround the fish bowl and pinky-turquoise background. Pairs of colors, like blue and orange, as well as green and red, are complementary colors. They appear opposite each other on a colour wheel, and, when placed next to one another in the painting, make each other look even brighter. This technique was used extensively by the Fauves, and is particularly striking in Matisse’s earlier works. Although he subsequently softened his palette, the bold orange, scarlet and crimson are reminiscent of the painter’s fauvist years, which continued to influence his use of color throughout his career.Henri Matisse made the striking scarlet to be a protagonist in this painting. He once remarked, \"Where I got the color red—to be sure, I just don't know. I find that all these things . . . only become what they are to me when I see them together with the color red.\"\r\nSubject\r\nBut why was the painter so interested in goldfish? These beautiful beings were introduced to Europe from East Asia in the 17th century. But hardly he was interested in them before viewing a large exhibition of Islamic art in Munich in 1910, and then spending two months in Spain studying Moorish art. Actually, goldfish have obtained his spectial attention during his visit to Tangier, Morocco, where he stayed from the end of January until April 1912. Matisse was impressed how the local population would day-dream for hours, gazing into goldfish bowls.Henri admired the Moroccans’ lifestyle as many other Europeans who visited North Africa at that time. Life under the hot sun appeared to him relaxed and contemplative. For him, the goldfish came to symbolize this tranquil state of mind and, at the same time, became evocative of a paradise lost, a subject frequently represented in art. They should be thus understood as a kind of shorthand for paradise in this painting.The mere name “goldfish” defines these creatures as ideal inhabitants of an idyllic place, which the artist was obviously seeking when he travelled to North Africa. It is also likely that Henri, who by 1912 was already familiar with the Islamic art, was interested in the meaning of gardens, water and vegetation in their culture. He apparently understood them as symbolizing the beauty of divine creation, the evocations of paradise.\r\nStudio as a metaphor of paradise\r\nStill, Goldfish, 1912 has not been painted in Morocco. Henri Matisse worked on it later, when returned home to Issy-les-Moulineaux, a suburb southwest of Paris. He leased a large house with a beautiful garden at Issy in September 1909 to escape the pressures of Parisian urban life. So, what we see at the canvas are the artist’s own plants, his own garden furniture, and his own fish tank.Flowerpots on the table, garden plants in the foreground and at the back, with their lavish green leaves and pinky blossom, obviously symbolize here paradise, the lost garden of Eden. Well, what else coud the studio be for this artist? It was Matisse’s place where he formed his ideas and implemented them, the place for the devine process – creativity. Goldfish, 1912 invites us to indulge in the pleasure of watching the bright color and graceful movement of the fish. Henri Matisse once wrote that he dreamt of “an art of balance, of purity and serenity, devoid of troubling or depressing subject matter, an art that could be […] a soothing, calming influence on the mind, something like a good armchair that provides relaxation from fatigue.” The perfect place for contemplation, the lost paradise in a wild urbanized world is precisely what the artist wanted this painting to provide for the viewer.\r\nJuxtaposition of viewpoints in the pictorial space\r\nHenri Matisse created a certain tension when depicting the space in this canvas. He shows us the fish simultaneously from two different view points. From the front, a viewer can easily recognize four swimming animals by their fins, eyes and open mouths. Seen from the top of a tank, however, the fish are merely suggested by colorful brushstrokes. When looking at the table-top tilted upwards, it’s difficult for us to imagine how the aquarium and flowerpots actually manage to remain on the table. The artist constructed this original juxtaposition of viewpoints and spatial ambiguity as opposed to Paul Cézanne’s still-life paintings. Cézanne defined art as “a harmony parallel to nature”. Matisse, on the contrary, did not imitate nature but reassembled it in his own pictorial reality. Being somewhat confusing for the viewer, his image nonetheless is well-balanced. The painter masterfully uses color and pattern which successfully hold composition together.\r\nDecorative manner\r\nHenri Matisse is peculiarly decorative. He paints plants and flowers in the upper section of the picture, above the fish tank, in such a decorative way that they resemble more a patterned wallpaper composed of flattened shapes and colors than real plants. However, if we then look at them through the transparent glass tank, we notice that they are distorted by water as it would be in reality.Goldfish, 1912 is an illustration of some of the major themes in Matisse’s art work: his use of complementary colors, his quest for an idyllic paradise, his appeal for contemplative relaxation for the viewer, his decorative manner of painting and his complex construction of pictorial space.Written by Natalia Korchina"},{"paintingTitle":"The conversation","artistName":"Henri Matisse","artistContentId":213888,"paintingContentId":"3eea9524-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy800/work/6f7/200785.jpg","paintingDescription":"How to attract the attention of the viewer with a uncomplicated view of the story? For the Fauvist Henri Matisse, this task is not particularly difficult. His recipe is simple: take a lot of deep blue, set off his figures in black and green, add blue and white striped — and get a picture that has for a hundred years causes fierce disputes in the camp of critics, art historians and other connoisseurs of the arts.\"The conversation\"as it was referred to the work of Henri Matisse, and on canvas we do see two interlocutors, passionate discussion of an issue. At first glance it may seem that this is a casual morning conversation between the couple: the man is clearly wearing pajamas, a woman — something like a dressing gown. However, a slight tension in the postures of interlocutors tells the viewer that in fact the conversation is about something important: a man holds hands in pockets, the woman leaned back in the chair and looks into the face of man. What happens in a room with blue walls and views of the flowery garden?Each painting Henri Matisse written in accordance with the canons of Fauvism, and \"Conversation\" is no exception. The story transmitted to us via a flat picture: the prospects are almost there, she barely discern in the landscape, which is visible from the window of the room. The smoothness of the flower beds and crown of the tree echoes the directness of the lines of the trunk and the fence, locked inside a fancy ornament wrought. The same confrontation lines and we see the characters in the paintings by Henri Matisse \"Conversation\": the figure of a woman like flows inside the chair, practically fused to the wall; standing in front of her man, on the contrary, consists of many straight lines, and the stripes on his pajamas only reinforce this feature. A kind of \"duel\" lines emphasizes selected by the artist colors: is the combination of these contrasting colors like deep blue, black, dark green. If you interpret the story in his colours, you can come to the conclusion that the conversation that takes place between the couple in the painting of Henri Matisse, not too pleasant for both of them.Some critics in the interpretation of this piece appeal to the values of the characters. So, the tree and the garden in General symbolize life, nature and its fertility. Brought to a forefront figure of man and woman represent the masculine and the feminine, which in Union give them new life.

Matisse has gained notoriety, his exhibitions are held worldwide. He remains true to his Manifesto: art should be understandable to anyone, regardless of his theoretical penetration depth. The task of art – not to confuse and disturb, and to give bliss, inner balance and pleasure. A significant impact on the work of Matisse has provided Delacroix. Travel East gave both artists inspiration, a Matisse at \"Algerian women\" famous predecessor were numerous odalisques, one of the symbols of painting Matisse (1, 2, 3).All as the selection was slim, feminine, soft curves, high Breasts, rounded hips, smooth lines of the body, by its very existence, claiming that heaven on earth is achievable. These flowers could grow exclusively in the atmosphere \"luxury, calm and pleasure\".In depicting odalisques, Matisse became deep, refusing from sharp contrasts politicheskogo period from the tendency to primitivistskie methods. Avoiding the extremes allowed him to find his own measure. \"Art rests not on the extremes. This thing is \"moderate, - he insisted. - Umeyama what? Yes mind, damn it! But the reasoning mind\".Coloring odalisques – a subtle, graceful, not blowing visual receptors immediate riot of colors, but engaging, enticing the viewer and not let go. Matisse himself said that the woman, vase, and flower for his equal. Odalisques seem like a luxurious jewelry, beautiful things, delighting the eyes (no, no, no explain, no accusations of \"lack of spirituality\" Matisse in sight there, talking about the fact that the purpose of the odalisque, as well as open flowers to delight the eye, to bear witness to beauty, be that beauty). And regardless of whether they depicted naked, Toplessor dressed wrapped Lee in a thin veil or heavy silk they fulfill their mission successfully. Odalisques became the straw that broke the last resistance of critics. Art critic, cubist Andre Lot after the exhibition, 1923 in the gallery Bernheim in Paris surrendered and admitted: \"Matisse is a magician... at first glance, these light fabrics, like storing or scattered fleeting touch of hands, to forget the objections that you'd want to avoid. You surrender, you are defeated\". This Nude, the lightest gas in the skirt \"Seated odalisque\" is depicted in the background orientalising patterns recognizable reference to struck the artist during his travels to the East of the Moorish ornaments. The atmosphere of the paintings – East, West, with its constant race for achievements have no place here. Odalisque Matisse know that the essence of life – in the enjoyment of it. The sexy true Oriental odalisques, it is in any case not aggressive adoption – flower no need to prove that he is a flower. Odalisques of Matisse, of course, resonate with odalisque Ingres. The key difference between the disclosure of the topic from two masters elegantly described by Claude Roger-Marx. About odaliska Ingres: \"Do not occur at the sight of his odalisques feeling that he was pierced with desire and his own strain of full bliss?\"(1, 2). About odaliska Matisse: \"He rules over these creatures, conceived almost as the items in them it attracted not they, and scenic opportunities and the pleasure that they should deliver to the viewer\".One of the odalisques of Matisse, \"odalisque in red pants\", participated in a detective story. In 2002 the Museum of contemporary art in Caracas, the painting was stolen. The theft was discovered immediately, as the attackers replaced the original copy. To search was involved, the FBI, and only after 10 years was able to detect that the original is on Miami. Two years it took to get the painting back. In the summer of 2014 she was finally exhibited in Venezuela.

Boen – city, where was born Matisse – the whole country was famous for its skilled weavers and fabrics that they made. It produced silk and brocade, velvet and cashmere, French tweed and transparent tulle. A child Matisse liked to observe the work of weavers, how they achieve subtle shades, folding them into patterns on its machines, like the artist at his easel.Later, while studying in Paris, he spent the last money on buying little scraps of fabric from rag pickers – fragments of ancient tapestries and embroideries for his \"fabric Museum\". And much later he would be able to write models in luxurious dresses the most fashionable of the capital's buildings, made of tissues, made by the masters of his native city.

But the attitude Serova to the work of Matisse is known enough.\"Some of the work of Matisse I like, but only some, in General I don't understand it»one of his statements about the paintings of the Frenchman. But in a letter to the wife of Serov in more detail decode your ambiguous impression with them: \"Matisse, although I feel his talent and generosity, but still gives no joy, and strangely, everything else, but is something boring then you can think about. Like hard, crooked and askew, meanwhile, does not want to look at hanging things masters, executed in a familiar manner.\" What is remarkable: although Serov tried to keep \"Fruit and bronze\" portrait of Morozova as close to the original, it still failed to convey the absolute lack of volume objects – vases, statues, fruit – which makes them look more like part of the pattern on the carpet, than independent objects in the background. At the Serov, it seems that even slips into some semblance of linear perspective, which Matisse is not in sight. Apparently, he was not so easy to get rid of well-established academic habits as it might seem at first glance.But Matisse this was not a problem. On the contrary, by the time his career he just didn't see the point to even trying to approach realism: \"I was not interested in copying the object, – he explained in the book \"notes of a painter\". – Why write the appearance of the Apple, as if like nothing happened? What is the use of copies of the object, which nature and without supplies in great numbers and which you can always imagine more beautiful? It is important to show the relation of the subject to the artist's personality and the ability of the artist to organize his sensations and feelings.\"The compositional principle that built the \"Fruit and bronze,\" will be one of my favorite Matisse. He writes a lot of still lifes amid the quaint laid carpet or fabric that is in the picture from two planes – horizontal and vertical (1, 2, 3). And if to a variety of fabrics the artist had a special relationship because of his origin from the town of Bowen, famous for skilled weavers in the whole of France, the carpets, the situation is somewhat more complicated.First, Matisse is known for his love of Arab culture and art in General, and to the Oriental ornaments and arabesques in particular – where else, not on the carpets, they are always in excess? Besides the artist's biography the British writer Hilary Spurling describes the remarkable case has become a landmark in his life. Matisse loved to tell the story of the Belgian hypnotist Donato, who came to sessions in Bowen in 1884. In speeches, he inspired volunteers from the audience different images, under which they started, for example, trying to collect imaginary flowers, or to drink water from a stream, which in reality was not.When it was the turn of young Henry, something went wrong: \"Inside, it's like something clicked: through the green grass and blue water Creek (\"I've started to succumb to the charms\") on the floor stood out the usual carpet. “No! he shouted.

In Tangier he had planned to perform a number of orders for Russian collectorsSergei Shchukin and Ivan Morozov. The first of them hinted that it prefers to work with figures, but with the model search works here was extremely difficult. According to Muslim custom, women were not only forbidden to sit, but generally open the face (this law did not apply to prostitutes). Only two months later, the efforts of the local French owners of the hotel where the painter was staying – I was able to find a model. At that time, Dawn was no more than twelve years old – still a child by European standards, but in Morocco she was considered old enough to marry or start to engage in prostitution. But to pose the alien girl unable long: \"There's her brother, – wrote Matisse. – I think he would have killed her if he found out that she poses\". He was able to resume sessions with Zora during the second visit to Tangier almost six months later. When she was found, she worked in a brothel. So she posed for Matisse on the roof of the brothel, which was raised in between clients. Including this one, in total, the Moroccan became the heroine of three works of Matisse (1, 2).The artist has attracted national costume girl: this is the most detailed element in the painting \"Zora on the terrace\". While the brush model, he has devoted much less attention (one of the critics noted that no different \"stunning absence\"). During his recent visit to Moscow, the artist was very inspired by an old Russian iconography. This has affected the nature of the image characters of the Moroccan cycle, more like the faces of saints (1, 2). Without knowing the history of the painting, it is impossible to guess the occupation Going, so modest and chaste it looks.Although Matisse was not originally plan to write a triptych, he decided to combine the three paintings created at that time, \"Moroccan triptych\". In addition to \"Going on the terrace\", it also included paintings «The view from the window\"and \"The entrance to the Kasbah\".

But subordinate brand matasovsky term of the line chairs and stand under the flower, the geometry of the rhyming diagonals and the glaring absence of volume at the vase and the flower creates a magnetic effect, which picture you want to consider and explore in trying to unravel the secret of her appeal.Stingy set of colors, seems intended to illustrate the postulate Matisse about colors: \"The starting point of Fauvism, he wrote, – a decisive return to the beautiful blue, beautiful red, beautiful yellow – primary elements that excite our senses to the depths». \"Nasturtium\" is only conditionally can be attributed to Fauvism, is only thanks to frantic smear in the field of Dance, but the second part of the statement pattern strongly supports.Fell under her charm and critic James Tugendhold, which compared the pictorial effect of the work of Matisse with the radiance of stained glass and mosaics in cathedrals and basilicas. \"This becomes especially clear when, standing at the threshold of the Shchukin living room, you see \"Nasturtiums with 'Dance' \" and \"Conversation\", orange-pink bodies of the first blaze on a blue background as the Arabesque glass, – wrote art historian. – Look at the picturesGauguin and again on matasovsky “Nasturtium”: the first will seem brushed mural, the second — color window.

Once he saw Lydia quite differently- not just his efficient assistant, not just a nurse wife. The woman immediately wanted to write. \"Don't move!\"  and went for a sketchbook and a pencil. He wrote her all the time, could Wake up in the night and demand to pose, would not leave her even for a moment. Madame Matisse is not satisfied. She stated the condition: to get rid of Lydia. Faced with a choice \"either – or\", Matisse chose family. He wrote a very proper letter, in which he assured future employers Lydia that she had shown itself to be disciplined, diligent, capable...

He specially went to Munich to visit an exhibition of Islamic art, where he spent hours admiring carpets, ceramics, carvings and ancient coins. Therefore, a trip to Tangier was not only a good opportunity for the artist to work on commissions from the collector Morozov, but also to get acquainted with the intriguing culture.Yet, things went a little differently than expected there. Firstly, few of the locals agreed to pose for a foreign stranger because of the strict Muslim customs, and secondly, the Matisse couple chose an extremely bad time for travelling. The first two weeks of February 1912 it rained almost continuously, the city streets were flooded with rivers of dirty water, and it was rather difficult to leave the hotel. And the hotel itself left much to be desired: Villa de France could boast only an excellent view of the old town, while its rooms were dark, small and not particularly clean.Only after a two-week imprisonment, having barely resisted the temptation to go home, Amelie and Henri Matisse were able to get out for a walk in the city and enjoy the beauty of the exotic surroundings. “Once the rain stopped, there sprang from the ground a marvel of flowering bulbs and greenery,” recalled the artist, “All the hills round Tangier, which had been the colour of a lion's skin, were covered with an extraordinary green under turbulent skies as in a painting by Delacroix. What melting light, quite different from the Côte d'Azur.”The walls of the old town also barely resembled European urban landscapes, familiar to the Matisses. Traditionally, in the center of Moroccan cities towered a fortress, inside which there was the residence of the kings or the houses of the local nobility. Such ancient town blocks-citadels are called kasbahs. Matisse painted the entrance to one of them on the left side of the Moroccan triptych. The predominance of different shades of blue in the painting Entrance to the Kasbah was neither the artist's fancy, nor an artistic exaggeration. The houses inside the fortress wall of the kasbah are, indeed, most often painted white and blue, and even in modern photographs of the streets of Morocco’s old city sky-blue shades will still dominate. Apparently, during his stay in Tangier, Matisse was so imbued with blue that it became the main colour, uniting all the pictures of the Moroccan triptych (1, 2).Natalia Azarenko"},{"paintingTitle":"The interior with the case of a violin","artistName":"Henri Matisse","artistContentId":213888,"paintingContentId":"3eea952e-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1919, 60×73 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1200/work/e1b/280886.jpg","paintingDescription":"\"Interior with a violin case\" written in nice. The South of France for many artists was healing, Matisse was no exception. The motif of the window – one of my favorite Matisse, and his window is always open to the outside world. Whether it's a window overlooking the garden, window in empty roome or even window with closed shutters – still Matisse you will find the opportunity to open at least a small window!\"Window\" plots filled with light and peace, they are happy and soothing, breathing fresh illumined by the sun or the sea, or garden, or coming in a window of the sky. Friend-enemy-rival Matisse Pablo Picasso said \"in the womb Matisse the sun\". Written in nice picture is fully confirmed. The high window, expanding space, the azure of the sky, thickening at the transition lines in the sea, matching with the sky and the sea, the shade of the open case from which probably only took out the violin. White seems to be swaying from the sea, fresh wind, the curtains and the mesmerizing sight of the sunlight falling on the floor through a patterned balustrade enclosing the balcony of the rim. Here everything breathes with freshness and joy. Heritage travel in Morocco – Eastern arabesques cover the walls. In this picture, the markedly masterly Matisse black color, so scared of the Impressionists. \"When I didn't know what color to put, I took black. Black is power\"– said Matiss. However, under his brush black is all that he wants, in this case, subtlety, elegance and weightlessness. Matisse himself said that he had no theory, he puts on paint \"until it becomes good\"and all he wants is to tired man looking at his paintings, knows peace and joy.

Careful surprising was the attitude of Matisse to the potential audience. And the picture refers to the period of becoming an artist, he has not yet found himself, but this concern is the desire to give comfort – they already have. In life, by the way, the nature of Matisse was not angelic, especially if something fails to work. But that's life, and the purpose of art, he is seen to bring joy. The painting was done in the period of fascination with Matisse the pointillism – direction created Georges Seuratand Paul Signac. Latest and purchased the painting. Matisse interpreterpath the plot of dearly beloved \"Three Bathers\" Cezanne for buy this picture of his wife, Amelie Matisse, a year after the wedding he sold his wedding ring.

The work is accented by decorative, it is called, delights the eye. Next year he will write \"Woman in hat\" which will allow the color to be the absolute master of the canvas, while the artist seems to only gropes the boundaries of the possible. He had already discovered the poetry of color, but not yet brought it to the top of its approach.A couple of years, Matisse will write \"Joy of life\" also telling about the peace and bliss, but radically different from this picture. It has much more of the Matisse and neo-impressionism has no contours, the large areas filled with one color, contrasting combinations. The picture \"Luxury, calm and pleasure\" filled with a sense of bliss and heavenly bliss later, trying to find Paradise in Tahiti, Matisse finally convinced that heaven on Earth can only be created by the artist. Before us was one of the first attempts to create Paradise. Poses naked women idle and effeminate, on the tablecloth, spread out on the ground, wine and fruit.

Thanks to the interest of the Russian art patron to the work of French artist Matisse's family was finally able to make ends meet. Shchukin regularly supplied with his work, and in 1909, Matisse was able to rent a house in Issy-Les-Moulineaux in the suburbs of Paris, and a little later and redeem it.In 1911, the artist was rarely able to step away from the easel. He worked so much that sometimes it lead to anxiety attacks. Wife Amelie tried to prevent such a situation and output a Matisse from home. They walked for hours, it helped him to switch and to cope with the strain. Shchukin wanted to get three panels with allegorical motifs. He offered to think over such options as youth, maturity and old age, for example, as spring, summer and autumn. When Matisse began to work, was unable to adhere to any of the concepts. Although four major canvases painted in the same year, yet were United in one cycle. The American art historian Alfred Barr called them \"symphonic interiors\". In addition to the \"Pink Studio\" in the beautiful Suite Matisse entered the picture «Family portrait» (stored in the Hermitage) \"Red workshop» (Museum of modern art in new York city) and «Interior with eggplants\"(The Museum of Grenoble in France). Unites all of the works highlighted by decorative and strong influence of Eastern culture. The artist himself called these paintings with lots of small details and focus on the interior design rooms \"interior still life\".\"Pink Studio\" - the lightest of the four symphonic interiors, written in a transparent watercolor manner. Despite the fact that the image is far from realism (it lacks the volume and linear perspective), the picture is easy to discern other creations of Matisse. This canvas \"The girl with green eyes» (standing on the floor) and «Luxury II\"(hanging on the wall to the left), relief and even a fragment of the mural \"the Dance\". In fact, though, at the time of writing \"the Pink Studio\" scandalous «Dance» already was in Moscow at the Schukin, the order of which was written. Although, maybe it's a fragment first variant paintings stored in the Museum of modern art in new York.This was not the only deviation from the truth. In fact, the walls in the Studio Matisse was not pink. They were not red as in the painting \"the Red Studio\". When the artist came to visit and tried to find pink or red wall, as in the paintings, he replied: \"This wall does not exist! As you can see here, I have written the same pieces of furniture against a slate blue wall. It sketches, sketches if you want. As paintings, they did not satisfy me. Where'd I get this red, believe me, I don't know... I find that all of these things, flowers, furniture, dresser, when I see them together with this red, only become what they mean to me. Why, I don't know».26 APR 1911 \"Pink shop\" was shown at the Salon of independent in Paris. She took the place of paintings «The Manila shawl (Spanish)\"that so outraged the public that Matisse could not stand it and made a replacement. But the public complained and a new player on the field: canvas not yet had time to dry, and visitors entertained, leaving a fingerprint. Shchukin, arriving in Paris in July, bought the \"Workshop\" and \"Family of artist\". Under the pretext that the artist himself helped to place their work in their assigned rooms, philanthropist, invited the Frenchman to Russia: \"Shchukin said to me, you will see something quite unusual – recalled Matisse. – You already know the Mediterranean and a bit of Africa, but you don't know Asia, and you will see something similar to Asia in Moscow.\" Upon arrival to the collector, the artist has collected all of his paintings, placed in different rooms, one with a pink living room, which previously housed paintings by Degas and Cezanne. The canvas barely fit in two rows, and he had to hang them directly on top of stucco. The room is completely transformed; and of the paintings themselves, together, made the visitors a stunning effect. «I didn't know Matisse for real, until I came to the Shchukin, — admired critic James Tugendhold. – This sonorous chime of colors, rushing from the walls, these dissonances burning major and cold-a deep, purple and blue colors are driven apathy, pour cocoon fever, fresh cold, act as a laughing gas and, in total, give a feeling of fullness.

As part of the ceiling frescos commissioned by Pope Julius II (1444–1513) for the Sistine Chapel in 1508, it has been celebrated, analyzed, parodied, and debated, and it, more than almost anything else, has shaped the way the public imagined God, Adam, angels, and the Biblical creation of mankind. Esthetically, it is balanced and dynamic, and Adam’s muscular, youthful body draws on earlier Greek and Roman classical art as well as Michelangelo’s extensive knowledge of proportion and anatomy. Though at first glance it seems like a straightforward depiction of God granting Adam the spark of life as described in the Book of Genesis, like much Renaissance art it holds secret messages that art historians and the general public are still trying to decipher centuries later. The focal point of the Creation of Adam is the almost touching fingers of the first human and his creator. Michelangelo masterfully painted them as close to making contact as possible, leaving us to wonder whether this the moment just before God touches Adam, giving him life and representing the union of the earthly and the divine, or just after it, representing their separation. Adam is shown in a relaxed pose, seemingly willing to accept God’s gift, and God is a powerful, determined, imposing figure and surrounded and being held up by a flock of angels (and two often debated figures) against a red cape.Amongst the cherubs witnessing this key moment in Christian mythology is a feminine figure that seems to be significant to the Creator. She is brighter than the others and His arm is around her. Is it Eve, waiting to be born from Adam’s rib? The Virgin Mary? If so, is the cherub to her left, the one with Gods finger on his shoulder, Jesus? Is he turned away because one day he will have to suffer for the sins of his father’s new favorite? And that is surly the Archangel Michael flying below, as if supporting the whole cast. Amongst this heavenly entourage, is that Lucifer, the soon-to-be fallen angel, face half in shadow, grasping the woman’s arm (maybe it is Eve? Or is it both Eve, the sinner, and Mary, the saint, the image of a Universal Woman?) and whispering in her ear? And who is the unhappy-looking, brooding angel in the bottom left? Like any self-respecting Renaissance artist, Michelangelo left many clues, secrets, and mysteries for scholars and art lovers to ponder over for hundreds of years. One particular message that Michelangelo added to his masterpiece would be noticed only by the 20th century. In the October 10, 1990, issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, Frank Lynn Meshberger, MD, a gynecologist at St. John's Medical Center in Anderson, Indiana, pointed out that the shroud surrounding God and the angels looks incredibly like a human brain. Indeed, once you see it, it can’t be unseen. As was common for artists of his day, Michelangelo dissected corpses to learn more about human anatomy, and certainly knew what the brain looked like, inside and out. What was the master trying to convey by placing the Creator of the Universe in a giant human brain? Perhaps the real gift he portrayed Adam as accepting was intellect. Or maybe there was a more rebellious message he was trying to convey. Could the devoutly Catholic artist secretly have portrayed God as an imagination in the mind of Adam on the ceiling of one of the holiest places of the Catholic Church? If so, it would have been the greatest example of trolling in the history of mankind.Another enigma of the painting often pointed out is the fact that Adam has a bellybutton. Why would the first human, born without a mother, have needed a bellybutton? Was this an oversight on the part of the genius or another hint as to his true beliefs? The shadow behind Adam looks remarkably like a female breast, nipple and all. Did Michelangelo have doubts about the divine creation of mankind? Unfortunately, only the artist himself could answer these questions, and he is long dead, leaving us to only speculate and make educated guesses. Some have claimed that, instead of a brain, the form surrounding God is a uterus, the umbilical cord being His arm, reaching out and giving life to Adam.The angels, even Jesus, don’t look very happy to see Adam. Perhaps they are jealous of the human, or have the foresight to see what kind of trouble His new favorite creation will create. And Adam himself seems not very motivated to make the connection with his creator. His body is relaxed and passive, and he is making the minimal amount of effort to reach out his hand to God, who seems to be fighting a great wind to get to Adam, using all his might. What is this discrepancy meant to convey? That God wants us to come to him? That all it takes is the slightest attempt to make contact with the divine?Originally the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel was painted blue with gold stars, but in 1508 Pope Julius II commissioned Michelangelo to repaint it. The great artist was wary of taking on such a large project and suspected that he was expected to fail. After he initially turned down the order to paint just the twelve apostles, the Pope relented and gave Michelangelo a free hand to design the ceiling as he wished. In all, the master painted 460 square meters of frescoes and over 300 figures, portraying the creation, Adam and Eve, and the Great Flood. He also painted the Last Judgement, based on the Book of Revelations, covering the entire wall behind the alter.As the only true competition for da Vinci to the title “archetypal Renaissance man,” Michelangelo outshined all of his various rivals—inside the Church and out—with this truly world-changing masterpiece, influencing popular and religious culture to this day."},{"paintingTitle":"Holy family, known as the \"Tondo Doni\"","artistName":"Michelangelo","artistContentId":193104,"paintingContentId":"3f516d45-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1506, 120×120 cm • Oil, Wood","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1000/work/ea4/494170.jpg","paintingDescription":"There is still no description of this artwork.

In the French capital, he arrived in 1920 and quickly started Dating with avant-garde artists and writers. From that moment began the formation of the Miro as surrealist and, although he was never an official member of the movement, but throughout his life remained faithful to his ideas. Writer and poet andré Breton in the famous Manifesto of surrealism, released in 1924, considered one of the best art forms and tools to unlock the mysteries of the subconscious and promoted \"psychic automatism in its pure form\".Between 1924 and 1927, Joan miró wrote a great series of works which different researchers call \"automatic paintings\", \"paintings-dreams\" and \"poetic paintings.\" This series becomes a kind of watershed in the artist and refers to his rejection of figurative painting. Paintings from this period combines the use of smooth, mostly single-color background on which are scattered semi-abstract symbols. Sometimes these forms discern recognizable objects occasionally Miro completes the picture by one or two written words. However, the picture \"Composition\" different from many is written in the same 1927 work, for example, \"tick-Tick\", \"Picture\" and \"Circus horse\". Here he refuses not just from favorite blue background, but the background at all. \"Composition\" is almost devoid of color, and its elements are written on the bare canvas.Joan miró repeatedly called its principle of operation \"very spontaneous\". In 1948, talking about 20 years in Paris, he said that many of his paintings of that period were written under the influence of hallucinations from hunger, and he almost allowed them to see the light itself, following the movement of the brush. However, more recent studies suggest otherwise. The Joan miró Foundation in Barcelona kept a notebook of the artist, in which you can find many sketches and paintings of this period.

As a child, his father wanted him to go into the grocery business, but his heart was in the profession of artistry, and at age 11, he entered Le Havre secondary school of the arts. During his stay at the secondary school, he was known for the caricatures he would draw for the locals for ten to twenty francs each. Five years later, he met artist Eugene Bouldin, who taught him the techniques of “en plein air” painting and became his mentor. At the age of 16, Monet left school for Paris, where instead of studying the great artworks of the masters, he sat by the window and painted what he saw outside. \r\n\r\nWhen he was twenty-one years old, he joined the First Regiment of African Light Calvary in Algeria, for a seven year tour. But his stay was cut short after two years when he was hit by a bout of typhoid fever, and his aunt arranged for his release, as long as he continued his art studies. Upon his return to Paris, he studied the “en plein air” methods, along with Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Frederic Bazille, and Alfred Sisley, and developed the painting style that would soon be known as Impressionism. Upon the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, Monet fled to England, also traveling to the Netherlands before his return to Paris, after which he exhibited many of his works in 1874, at the first Impressionist Exhibition.\r\n\r\nUpon the death of his wife Camille to tuberculosis after the birth of their second child, Monet was resolved never to life in poverty again, and was determined to create some of the best artworks of the 19th century. By 1890, he was prosperous to buy a large house and garden, where he would continue to paint for the rest of his life. \r\n\r\nAs a painter of controlled nature, Monet’s garden was one of his biggest sources of inspiration. As such, he wrote precise instructions for his gardeners, with specific designs and color layouts, and amassed a large collection of botanical books. At one time, he employed seven gardeners at once. After his death of lung cancer, his only surviving child, Michel, was heir to the Monet family property, which has since been restored and opened to the public, including the vast gardens. \r\n ","story":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Monet","gender":"male","relatedArtistsIds":[],"popularPaintings":[{"paintingTitle":"Impression.

Later he painted it more than 20 times: at first, the fabulously fascinating bridge was flooded with light but 10-15 years later Monet lost his ability to distinguish colors and the Japanese bridge in his paintings sometimes was immersed in a bluish haze, sometimes lighted up with the crimson flame, or even drowned in intense shades. But this picture was created in the very beginning, when the bridge, inspired by the Japanese engravings, had just been installed.At the end of the XIX century, almost no one knew of the village of Giverny - except for the residents themselves and their neighbors from the nearest villages. It was inhabited by 300 people, had one school and several taverns. Today it is a legendary city that hosts thousands of tourists and admirers of the artist, who turned the small village into an artistic and horticultural Mecca.Claude Monet spent a lot of time looking for a pink stucco house with grey shutters: he would go for a few days on a trip along the Seine, come into the restaurants and ask the locals whether there were any houses for rent nearby. And that house had to be really big, since Monet had quite a large family: Alice Hoschede, the artist's future wife and 8 children from their first marriages.A few years later, the artist bought the house, installed a huge window in the studio and stayed there for the rest of his life. The neighbors laughed at Monet: \"Do you plant flowers? What can you get from them?\" But Monet had never been so obsessed and happy: he cut down the cypress alleys, planted roses in the yard, bought books and magazines for gardeners, corresponded with nurseries, and his friends even brought him rare seedlings from all over the world. When this madman decided to buy the adjacent plot, a continuous swamp, the inhabitants of Giverny weren't even surprised.In the next 30 years, Claude Monet had things to do. He drained the swamp and put a pond in its place; over time, a fabulous garden grew there: weeping willows, wisteria, rhododendrons, bamboo, roses, and, of course, the famous water lilies from Japan. Before leaving on a long journey in search for motives, Monet couldn't sleep and work when he suddenly learned from his wife's letters that unexpected frosts had struck Giverny. When the garden suffered from dust, cold or clumsy visitors, the artist suffered with it.Walking on Monet's bridge would be sweet, scary and incredibly interesting at the same time. Look, the entrance to the bridge can be seen, but it's is somewhere outside the picture. Philosopher Nikolai Alexandrov walked on Monet's bridge with a ruler and a compass to have discovered that the bridge was a direct path to a new, modern art: \"This is the major motive of modernist style,\" said Alexandrov, \"in the absence of people the world lives its own mysterious life, but pretends to be neutral when they are watching.\"The only thing left from the artificial human world here is the bridge. But if you look closer, you'll see that it's also just a clean, primed canvas, just a gap in the living world.Author: Anna Sidelnikova"},{"paintingTitle":"Grainstack (Sunset)","artistName":"Claude Monet","artistContentId":211667,"paintingContentId":"401cfaa2-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1891, 73.3×92.7 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy800/work/04c/360664.jpg","paintingDescription":"‘My paintings have gone to the savages. Seems like I’m destined to die a failure,’ complained Claude Monet on finding how popular his pictures had become in America.If you want to see most of the Haystacks series, you have to go to New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Minneapolis, Farmington, Boston. When Paul Durand-Ruel exhibited the Grainstacks and the Poplars series in his gallery, they sent the French into raptures and aroused overseas art lovers’ purchase interest.‘People want nothing but Monets, apparently he can’t paint enough pictures to meet the demand. Worst of all they all want Sheaves in the Setting Sun! … Everything he does goes to America at prices of four, five and six thousand francs,’ Camille Pissarro wrote to his son.At that period, the person particularly close to papa Monet was his stepdaughter Blanche, a real guardian angel for him. She was the only one of his many children, natural as well as adopted, who showed interest in painting and mastered it. At daybreak, they would set off together in quest of motifs. Blanche would push a trolley loaded with papa’s unfinished canvases — it was Claude’s new idea of working on different pictures at different times of the day. He was successful at last, he had paid out the cost of the house and hired a gardener, but only now did he realise that he had found the only possible, though terribly hard way of capturing ‘the fleeting light covering the vegetation everywhere.’ In his trolley, he had the six-o’clock grainstack, the eight-o’clock one, the midday and the afternoon ones, and the ones painted at sunset, in a fog, and on a cloudy day. Sometimes, he started rummaging for a sketch so as not to miss the right lighting (that never lasted longer than 15 to 30 minutes). He picked a canvas that seemed the right one, touched it with quick brushstrokes, kept on modifying it until it turned into quite a new picture. Then, what a surprise it was to come across the very canvas he had failed to find when he needed it!Four years after Durand-Ruel’s grainstack boom in America, an impressionist exhibition was held in Moscow. One of those who came to look at the artworks by the celebrated French art revolutionaries was a successful lawyer who, a short time before, had been invited to teach Law at a university. Monet’s Grainstack made him stop bewildered and wondering. The painting was absolutely incomprehensible, but the emotions it aroused were far deeper and seemed more real than those from a traditional narrative canvas. He came nearer and read the title of the picture, Grainstack.The successful 30-year-old lawyer would give up the allure of the professorship. Instead, he would go to Munich to study painting.

And perhaps worst of all he was able the role of the husband, especially the first time. Camille Monet was one of the most miserable and unfortunate of women throughout the history of the scenic heroines, and wives of artists. 18-year-old model Camilla Donse, the daughter of a merchant, posing young handsome Monet paintings for \"The woman in green\" one of the most successful and rapidly became famous. Painting is not just accepted in the Cabin, but was awarded several good reviews. Nice Camille, Monet happy, they are young, in love and they think that everyone is beautiful in their lives is just beginning. Following a few desperate years, Camille and Claude live in a damp, cold rooms, often without electricity and heating, and very often without food. Sometimes Renoir comes to visit them, to write along with Claude (including Camille), and brings a little of bread for a few days enough. Sometimes in the night they collect things and run from the next farm-house, knowing that the next morning will not be able to pay the owner of the debt for a few months. Claude works from morning till night, like a man possessed, without the approval in the official Salon, no recognition among customers. His pictures do not buy. At least 30, 50 francs he was ready to get the dime. Camilla when the time comes to give birth, Monet would go to look for inspiration – not really like mad love.

The figures of people on it had to exceed the average human height in half. In the forest of Fontainebleau, the artist made many sketches, for which he asked his friends to pose, and soon sketched a preliminary version of the painting; and this version is now in front of you. The picture should be called Luncheon on the grass.The title of the future work, and its general idea was a tribute to another Luncheon on the grass, Edouard Manet's painting, which two years earlier had been presented at the famous Salon des Refusés (French for \"exhibition of rejects\") and caused a storm of indignation of critics, salon judges and visitors. At that time Claude Monet, a student of a private studio, was hugely impressed by the painting, and decided now to declare his admiration for Manet and make something just as incredible. He did not intend to disturb the public with naked women, as Manet did, he wanted to paint bright sunspots and contrasting deep shadows on the clothes and faces, the grass and the white veil.It is difficult to imagine where and how the young artist kept a huge canvas while working on it. But later Monet told in detail how he managed to get to the upper part of the painting, being only 165 centimeters tall. He dug a deep long ditch, lowered the picture into it and found himself at the right level. Monet was obsessed with this work; he even wrote to his friends that he could not think of anything else and would go mad if he failed to finish it. This work took too much effort and, to be honest, was far from being cheap.Today, recreating the overall view of the finished Luncheon on the Grass is possible only due to this preliminary sketch. The final version did not survive, or rather, survived in a horribly shabby state, as a result of being in several scrapes. Half of his life Monet was in debt - he ran in the middle of the night from a rented apartment, when he could not pay his landlord; for a long time shared a studio with Frédéric Bazille and Auguste Renoir; quarreled with the owners of the hotels and made promises. And once, left without a penny in his pocket, he folded his huge Luncheon on the Grass and left it to the owner of the apartment as collateral. Monet couldn't get money for a long time and returned to reclaim the painting many years later. All that time it lay wrapped in a roll in a damp cellar - and in some places began to rot. The artist had to cut the painting into separate fragments and only three intact panels were kept. But only two of these panels reached the museum walls - today they are kept in the d'Orsay Museum (1,2), each - in a separate frame. The third panel is missing. A huge final version of the picture was slightly different from this preliminary, but quite independent and completed version. Monet changed the color of the dress of the girl on the left from white to gray-red and replaced the central figure - a boy who was seated on the tablecloth - for a man. A new character of the Luncheon on the Grass, a cheerful, large bearded man, is very similar to the artist Gustave Courbet."},{"paintingTitle":"The Saint-Lazare station in Paris arrival of a train","artistName":"Claude Monet","artistContentId":211667,"paintingContentId":"401cfaa5-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1877, 81.9×101 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy800/work/b1c/263673.jpg","paintingDescription":"Monet was born in 1840 and only two years after his birth in France was allowed by law, the construction of the passenger railway. The government issues a Charter and concludes contracts with various companies for the implementation of the main building of the XIX century. By 1914 the Railways of France became one of the most developed in the world, and the length of track amounted to 60 thousand kilometers. It was a coup, to set a whole new pace of life, opening new view of the world.Somewhere in the middle of this rapid development of the railway, in 1877, for the 37-year-old Claude Monet train became a new obsession. And in the fine arts of France opened a new, bold and obviously doomed to misunderstanding by his contemporaries, theme. Industrial landscapes by Monet angered critics to the teeth gnashing, they excitedly excelled in the pejorative characteristics. In the pages of \"Figaro\" appeared, for example, this passage: \"In General, Claude Monet was able to accurately convey the very unpleasant impression on us simultaneous whistles of several locomotives\". This year, the artist rented a small Studio near the Gare Saint-Lazare in Paris, where he hid from the creditors a part of his paintings. View smokestack locomotives captures so much of Claude Monet, he decided on a new series – this time in the heart of the modern city. But writing from memory, Monet are not used to.The son of Jean Renoir in the book dedicated to his father and his entourage, recalls how Claude Monet set up a shop right at the train station. \"They'll have to delay the Rouen train: lighting much better half an hour after departure\", – the artist has decided. Next – matter of technology. Monet put on my best suit, shirt with lace cuffs and went to conquer my new plein air. Playing elegant walking stick, he announced to the Director: \"I'm the artist Claude Monet. I decided to write to your station! Hesitated which of the two stations to choose – North or yours, but finally settled on your – it is more typical!\" Anyone who saw him then thought he was having a huge credit to the station and personally to the Director. Monet for delayed trains, clean platforms, was filled with the desired amount of smoke at the right time of day. The outcome of this presentation was the 12 paintings (see the whole series), which were immediately bought by art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel: that was an amazingly shrewd connoisseur of art and bought Monet paintings for several decades before they began to bring money and fame.Author: Anna Sidelnikova"},{"paintingTitle":"Poplar","artistName":"Claude Monet","artistContentId":211667,"paintingContentId":"401cfaa6-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1891, 116.2×72.2 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1200/work/bd2/263704.jpg","paintingDescription":"Monet probably would have gone crazy if I didn't finish the series of 20 paintings. It was a real obsession, which he could only call trees, water lilies, haystacks or flowers. He often did incredible things to save in the right view of the object of his obsession: pay the farmer so that in the spring I cut the oak leaves in accordance with the original winter sketch that paved a road near his home, the dust does not settle on its flowers, bathed haystacks, when they were going to remove from the field staged spectacular performance for the Director of the station to impound the train and provide the necessary amount of smoke on the platform.On the series \"Poplar\"(see all works with poplars) Monet worked throughout the spring and summer of 1891, which bought the island nettle, which had the desired look. He loaded the cart about 20 – 30 canvases, carried them to the place best terms and worked on each of them at different times of the day. Sometimes the lighting was changing so fast that some state lasted only 7 minutes. When the sun moved, the artist quickly searched among the jobs that have been started need to be able to leave her a few color accents or change completely.Monet himself invented this method himself worried him the most desperate moments of creative impotence. One day he in a rage threw it to the water and the canvas, which long was, and paint brushes. Left. Back. Climbed into the river to get at least a brush and paint. One morning, rolled up to the island of his cart with future masterpieces, Monet found that poplar trees marked for cutting down. Of course, he paid to avoid being cut, until the series is finished.This is the most \"noisy\" series by Monet. And \"Haystacks\" and \"Rouen Cathedral\" from one picture to another, changing lighting, changing the air density and color of masonry or fields. And poplar beauty, and even its malleability wind, they rustle leaves and creaking of old trunks in each captured moment. The force of the wind or the reflection of the trees in the river is a new dimension in which Mona makes changing your poplar.The artist always wanted his series remained a single entity, occupying the whole wall in a Museum or private collection. He was very valuable this effect is lived in one of the Museum's hall of light day. None of the series of Claude Monet, with the exception of \"water Lilies\", for which he invented a special Museum gathered in one place.

One of them is here, in the collection of the Pushkin Museum in Moscow, and the other - in the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas city. And both museums have the right to hope that it was their \"Boulevard\" that participated in the very First Impressionist Exhibition, which took place in Paris in 1874.It is now impossible to find evidence in favor of one of the paintings, but one can get an idea of how this picture was perceived by the artist's contemporaries. The same art critic Louis Leroy from the newspaper Le Charivari, who called the young artists Impressionists, ruthlessly walked along the Boulevard des Capucines by Claude Monet. He wrote:\"But those spots were obtained by the same method as that used to imitate marble: a bit here, a bit there, slap-dash, any old way. It's unheard-of, appalling! I'll get a stroke from it, for sure.\"The critic couldn't stop complaining about how outraged he was with the obscure dots in the lower part of the picture. \"Then do I look like that when I'm walking along the boulevard des Capucines? Blood and thunder!\" For the sake of justice, Monet really distorts the prospect of the boulevard and with the help of several tricks creates a sense of a quick, casual glance thrown from above to a noisy, crowded street.The picture was painted from the balcony of the photographer Nadar's studio, which later hosted the First Impressionist Exhibition and where Louis Leroy came up with the term \"Impressionism\". According to the surviving photographs, we can assume that the photo studio occupied two upper floors of a 4-storey building. And judging by the perspective in which the houses on the opposite side of the street are painted, Monet stood with his easel on the third floor. Here all the facts add up. But the fiacres and passers-by are rendered as if the artist climbed at least on the roof, if not higher.The paintings of the Impressionists were laughed at by both critics and viewers. The main reproach and occasion for ridicule was the underdevelopment, sketchiness, which the upstart artists dared to call the new value of painting. It was enough just to look at a few exemplary salon paintings of that time and compare them with the Boulevard des Capucines, to understand how enraged the critics were by the young artists' new pictorial and compositional choices. Monet was not interested in people - he mercilessly cut off the figures of the two men standing on the balcony, leaving only a hat of one of them. The image of every person walking along the boulevard is made at best by three or four brush strokes. More often - by just one. The fiacres are drowning in a thick golden river, reflecting the sunlit street. And one brazen gold zigzag stroke was thrown almost in the center of the picture. Monet was only interested in that light effect - a big shadow from the building, which at sunset cut a wide, sunny boulevard. And also in a sense of continuous movement that was created solely by means of painting.Author: Anna Sidelnikova"},{"paintingTitle":"The Rue Montorgueil in Paris, festival of 30 June 1878","artistName":"Claude Monet","artistContentId":211667,"paintingContentId":"401cfaa8-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1878, 81×50 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1200/work/332/297910.jpeg","paintingDescription":"This painting and her twin, written on a nearby street of Saint-Denis the only Patriotic utterances Monet for the rest of his long life. Where did this passionate Patriotic impulse of the artist, which is always much rather swam somewhere in the middle of the river to look into the water or climbed on the rocks, looking for the best sea view? The artist, who even to the end of the First world war decided to give his country a huge mural of water lilies. For this you need to understand what was happening in Paris at the world exhibition of 1878.It took 7 years after the other war, Franco-Prussian war, which became a huge national disaster and disgrace for the French war, plunging the country into a deep crisis and claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. And finally, France mourned the loss and begin to revive. It's time the world to demonstrate great spiritual power of the people, who have overcome postwar hardships. The government announces the world exhibition of agricultural and industrial products and works of fine art.It was the exhibition, for which was built the great Palace of the Trocadero concert hall and stations, the unique water supply and elevators, and covered all adjacent to the square boulevards electric lamps Yablochkov. This is the exhibition, which showed the head of the Statue of liberty and presented to admiring spectators sewing machine singer, the phonograph, improved the telephone and the typewriter.In Paris, a military parade, played 22 orchestra, tri-colored flags hung in every window. They say that even the hearses carrying the dead then, was decorated with tricolors. And, of course, a riot of red, white and blue seized the Monet – three colors that flood the street is noisy, bright wave of hope. Three colors and nothing more, only an overwhelming artist's delight. When you look at the picture the first time, even there is no doubt that before the eyes – hundreds of French flags. But it turns out that if you look closely, it's not even the flags is a separate key strokes of colors that only due to the peculiarities of peripheral vision of the beholder are formed in the desired image. Only a single, almost fleeting moment you can see the Rue Montorgueil. This illusion is clear the world, which is only in the eye of the beholder for one moment connect the fragments and alive, delights not only art historians but also scientists studying the features of perception of color human. \"Monet is just an eye. But what an eye.\" - repeat those and others after Cezanne.By the way, on the same day from another window, and another street wrote Edouard Manet, who saw the same flags, but felt occurring quite differently. On his street with festive flags is a one-legged man on crutches, most likely returned several years ago with the war, which the French now so hard to forget and leave in the past. For the painter Edouard Manet, every single moment has a past and a future. Manet – a philosopher and a sage, a Mans is not only the eyes.Author: Anna Sidelnikova"},{"paintingTitle":"Forty","artistName":"Claude Monet","artistContentId":211667,"paintingContentId":"401cfaa9-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1869, 89×130 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy800/work/71d/325820.jpg","paintingDescription":"The sun artist Claude Monet awoke with the dawn and sleep at sunset. Bright or scattered brush or flood all around, the light was his inspiration and passion. And the glare of the sun on short winter days – it's all the same sun. Monet wore three coats, gloves and penetrating frost left to write ice drift on the riveror haystacks in the snowbecause the snow is not just another form of life. Snow is a natural white canvas on which to study the sun and shadows even more reckless than on the stone or on the water. Snow is a pure scientific experiment.The Painting \"The Magpie\" was one of the first snowy landscapes to impressionism in General and Claude Monet. This landscape is so deep, so cozy and warm that it is hard to imagine, looking at him as a hungry beggar, the artist leaves home and his patient wife and young son and goes into the cold to look for blue shadows on bright snow. Not counting on the understanding and recognition. For these colored shadows of Monet will accrue from critics, who firmly believes in gray. \"I think the artist is hallucinating!\" - laughed the Newspapers, and behind them the crowds of spectators. The snow is blue, purple or green! These mailki just crazy! The picture will not be accepted into the Salon of 1869 – it is simply outrageous, some conglomeration of colorful spots.A single note in the score, a small mark on the fields of notebook, forty is the only thing in the picture and the only movement on it.

He stayed at the Savoy Hotel and from the window of the room painted the views of the Thames: with Charing Cross Bridge and Waterloo Bridge. In the late afternoon, he worked from a location inside St. Thomas's Hospital, from the terrace of which opened a view of the Houses of Parliament. In London, Monet was certainly most interested in fog and those special color effects it created under different lighting. Fog here is never the same, it can be green, purple, pink and blue. Monet wrote to his wife Alice: \"The weather is deadly, a terribly cold wind... clouds and sun without discontinuing... One marvel after another, each lasting less than five minutes, it was enough to drive one mad. No country could be more extraordinary for a painter.\" According to the established and familiar system, Monet begins the London series with painting several canvases at different time of day. But every day there were more of them - and Monet was working at more than 60 canvases, which he didn't not even expect to complete. The artist hoped to complete depicting at least several states of the city - but did not manage to complete a single one. At home Monet was fascinated by water lilies, which he painted every day, delaying his work on the London series.Art critics argued a lot whether a few or even most of Monet's views of London were painted at the artist's home in Giverny from memory. Because it took the painter another 3 years before he found the series complete and allowed the art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel to have a look at them. Monet was more than 60 years old, already a famous and recognized artist, whose new works were being waited for by the collectors on both sides of the ocean. At the persistent requests of the dealer to send at least a few he replied, \"I cannot send you a single canvas of London. It is indispensable to have them all before me, and to tell the truth not one is definitely finished. I develop them all together.\" Scientists at the British Royal Society studied the dates indicated on those letters to Monet's wife, where he wrote about his observations of the sun. Then they calculated three possible places on the terrace of St. Thomas Hospital, where the artist could work, and compared these coordinates with the movement of the sun in London at that time of year relative to the spires of the Houses of Parliament. It turned out that Monet absolutely accurately conveyed what was happening in the sky of London. In 1904, at the gallery of Paul Durand-Ruel, there was held an exhibition dedicated to Monet's exhausting London's plein air painting which stretched for several years. There were exhibited 37 paintings - and most of them were immediately purchased by American collectors. Today, one can see Monet's Houses of Parliament with seagulls here, at the Pushkin Museum and at the Princeton University Art Museum in New Jersey.Author: Anna Sidelnikova"},{"paintingTitle":"Nenufar","artistName":"Claude Monet","artistContentId":211667,"paintingContentId":"401cfaac-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1926, 602×219 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/orig/work/f9c/222796.jpg","paintingDescription":"There is still no description of this artwork.

Collected my belongings, boarded the train and left for new experiences. Etretat is a town on the Normandy coast, near the port of Le Havre, where Claude grew up. Monet had been there many years ago in the summer and autumn together with his wife Camille (she dies in 1879) and recently-born son Jean. And now this madman goes to battle with the waves and the cliffs of Etretat in the winter. He stayed at a hotel right on the seafront and a few paintings writes from the window of his room. Weather does not work for a long time. When the rains subside and the wind, Monet is selected on one of the most extreme trip in your life: walking on stones and caves or in a fishing boat through the narrow tunnels in the rocks. The artist pays the local boys, so they helped him carry the gear and canvases on the West beach, which offers the best view of the cliffs of Etretat. Maupassant at the same time, lived in étretat and met with Monet: \"...He stared at the spots of light and shadow, waiting, lying in wait right moment, and then suddenly like catching a ray of sunshine or passing cloud, and with a few rapid movements of the hand put them on the canvas without thinking about the conventions and despising all false. Once I managed to spy as he caught the iridescent gleam of light fell onto the white rock, and immediately recorded it in the form of several strokes of yellow hue, an awesome way of transmitting this subtle effect is dazzling glow. Another time he had gained the palm of the downpour that hit the sea and splashed it flows on the canvas. He wrote the rain, only rain and nothing more, and behind his veil just discern the outlines of waves, rocks and sky...\"On the Normandy coast in the winter cold, wet and windy, to get closer to the rocks obtained only at low tide. And plein air turns into a battle with the elements. One day Monet was so fascinated by the work that they completely forgot about the approaching tide. Canvases, paints, brushes washed with water, he got soaked and barely got to the hotel on the icy water. But in this winter journey, it's tormenting to despair, does not weather and not drowned paint. At home with the children left Alice and right next to their house lived Ernest aside, the first and still the legal husband of Alice and father of her children. Monet writes everyday emails, Declaration of love and going crazy from the suspense: suddenly, Alice decides to return to her husband, and his whole life will go to pieces. \"I love you more than you think, much more than it seemed... I sit and cry. Do I have to get used to the idea of living without you, my dear, my poor love?\" \"I love you. I still can talk to you about this, right?\"But Alice, of course, nowhere on Monet is not going, she Vitae with a sinking heart, reads the first few years of the recognition of Claude's in love and waiting for his return.

As a child, he was often ill in the winter, and kept out of school. To pass the time, he spent his days drawing. He also had a troubled childhood, as his mother died of tuberculosis after the birth of his youngest sister, and his favorite sister died of the same illness nine years later. His father was also a bit of a religious fanatic, who would read Edvard and his sisters ghost stories and the stories of Edgar Allen Poe. The vivid ghastly tales, combined with his poor health, the young Munch was plagued by nightmares and paranoid visions of death, which he would later incorporate into his artwork. \r\n\r\nIn his teens, he moved from drawing and dabbling with watercolors to painting with oils, and he only spent one year in technical college before he left to follow his dream of being a painter. His early paintings brought much unfavorable criticism, and his father rebuked him for his artworks, but continued to give him a living allowance. Later, unhappy with Munch’s paintings, he destroyed one of his nudes, and refused to grant him any more money for his art supplies. \r\n\r\nMuch live much of his life in a nihilistic, bohemian lifestyle, in which binge drinking and brawling were the favorite pastimes, to his father’s constant disapproval. After his father’s death, leaving the Munch family destitute, and Munch, feeling that everyone around him had died, was plagued by suicidal thoughts. His personal tragedies and psychological idiosyncrasies evolved into a symbolic art form that expressed more internal emotion and feeling than projected an image of outside reality. He often refused to sell his paintings, calling them his children, and so would create reproductions of them to sell. \r\n\r\nHis critical reception improved by the 1890’s, and the attendance to his exhibitions increased, although reviews remained bleak. In 1898, he began a relationship with Tulla Larsen, who wanted to get married. Munch, fearing marriage as much as sexual relationships, fled Tulla a year later. In a later reconciliation attempt, there was an argument in which a gun went off, injuring two of Munch’s fingers, and ruining Munch’s chance at marriage.\r\n\r\nIn 1908, Munch had an acute break with reality, seeing hallucinations and suffering feelings of persecution, as if he was on the brink of insanity. He began therapy, including a controlled diet and electrification, which stabilized his personality. Thus began his more financially and professionally successful phase in his life, where he received many commissions and was able to provide well for his family. He spent the last two decades of his life in relative isolation, painting at one of his many estates. Today his legacy, once smeared with rumors that he was a Nazi sympathizer, includes many robberies of his works, his prices at auction, and his face now being featured on the Norwegian currency.\r\n  ","story":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edvard_Munch","gender":"male","relatedArtistsIds":[],"popularPaintings":[{"paintingTitle":"Scream","artistName":"Edvard Munch","artistContentId":185320,"paintingContentId":"40850b40-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1893, 91×73.5 cm • Pastel, Tempera, Cardboard","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1200/work/bc9/116638.jpg","paintingDescription":"Everyone knows \"The scream\", even people who are far from the fine arts and do not immediately recall the name of the artist. The Scream became a terrible symbol of the 20th century, repeated many times in popular culture, written at the turn of the century and redrawn a thousand times by advertisers, animators, filmmakers and graphic designers. This ambiguous popularity could overtake the masterpiece of painting only in one case: when it is at maximum power sound technique, emotion and idea.Edvard Munch painted the first version of The Scream in 1893. There must be some deep psychological explanation for the fact that the most important of his paintings was repeated by Munch several times in a lifetime. He painted and re-painted the same subjects. But in the story of \"The Scream\" the most important meaning of the four copies (plus lithograph) can be safely assumed as the economic and adventurously-criminal one. The obsession with which the artist repeated the same story in different techniques and in different periods of his life, gave the opportunity to acquire a famous painting not only by two main museums of Oslo, but also by a private collector for a record sum. On May 2, 2012 an American businessman Leon David became the happy owner of the pastel author's copy of \"The Scream\" created in 1895 . It was purchased for 119.922.500,00 USDOne copy of \"The Scream\", painted on cardboard in mixed media using oil and tempera is on display at the National gallery in Oslo (a variant created in 1893 is the reproduction to the left of the text) and the Munch Museum (version in 1910). The Munch Museum is another \"Scream\" - painted in pastels in 1893. And from both of the museums the paintings were stolen. For the first time the famous painting was stolen in 1994 from the National gallery: the whole adventure took less than a minute to break the window, remove the picture, turn off the alarm. The thief in the note he thanked the guards for a bad job, but that was a serious justification – just at this time was broadcasting the opening of the winter Olympic games in Norway.The second kidnapping \"The Scream\" did not look like an exciting intellectual art-detective. In 2004, the robbers just broke into the Munch Museum in broad daylight, at gunpoint caretakers and visitors, and tore from the wall \"The Scream\" and \"Madonna\". Two years passed before slightly damaged paintings got back to their places.Rich adventurous story of this work is related not only to its considerable cost, but with the magical effects of \"The Scream\" on the viewer. Rumor has it that all 4 copies are cursed, they bring pain and fear. But the most important shamanic techniques in this picture is, of course, color and line. A feeling of impending disaster, terror and the ruthless natural disaster here in the trembling, as if in the sultry air, lines, saturated, unnatural contrasts and deep colors. This experience is so strong that critics, as one can see in this image is always more: the symbol of the 20th century with its wars, disasters, and turmoil, the hostility of nature, and sometimes the entire universe in relation to man.Author: Anna Sidelnikova"},{"paintingTitle":"Vampire","artistName":"Edvard Munch","artistContentId":185320,"paintingContentId":"40850b41-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1895, 91×109 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/orig/work/b10/258954.jpg","paintingDescription":"The original name of the picture \"Love and pain\" - much thinner reflects her mood. \"Vampire\" sounds like a death sentence. The author of this later names a friend of the artist Stanislav Przybyszewski. In fact, the painting lives a more difficult life.It is impossible to tell about the story element of the film, and it is illogical in relation to the Munch. No matter what there relations are depicted a man and a woman, it is important to stay with them the entire spectrum of opposing, conflicting and difficult emotions: despair, fear, delight, pity, tenderness, absorption, saturation and so on to infinity.\"Vampire\" as most of the paintings by Munch, is part of the huge \"frieze of life\" and responds in this Symphony for a very intimate facets of human existence. Munch was always sure that a woman drains a man, deprives him of the inner strength and freedom. No whirlwind romance couldn't convince him otherwise. This love experiences occupy a Central place in \"the Frieze of life.\"Versions of the painting the artist left enough so she has time to visit private collections and renowned auction, and in public museums and in the hands of kidnappers.In 1988, the painting was stolen from the Munch Museum, and one of the kidnappers also came under serious influence of the Norwegian genius. Six months later, the \"Vampire\" was found, the kidnapper Fell Anger was thrown into jail, but he was not satisfied, and 8 years later again came for the Munch, just for now \"Shout\" in the National gallery.Author: Anna Sidelnikova"},{"paintingTitle":"Summer Night","artistName":"Edvard Munch","artistContentId":185320,"paintingContentId":"40850b42-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1902, 115.5×101.5 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1200/work/3ab/570978.jpg","paintingDescription":"There is still no description of this artwork.

Sure enough, it would be The Scream and then – The Girls on the Bridge. In 30 years, Edward Munch created 12 versions of this subject – quite enough to divide these paintings between the main museums and auctions and to support the media glory of The Girls... with either curatorial projects, or record sales.One of the versions of this picture was sold at Sotheby’s auction for $54 million and became the second most expensive work by the Norwegian, after \"The Scream\", of course.But unlike The Scream, The Girls on the Bridge was received enthusiastically by both: viewers and critics contemporary to the artist. It was called the most perfect, mature and harmonious among Munch’s pictures. The main mood of the artist’s paintings, that white-hot anxiety, bordering on desperation, suddenly subsided in The Girls on the Bridge and cooled down to melancholy. On the scale of happiness, calm loneliness, thoughtfulness and sadness were perhaps the highest mark among those, available to Munch. He was just not capable of feeling better. Many years later, the artist described 1902, the year when The Girls on the Bridge was created, as follows: \"...those years from 1902 until the Copenhagen clinic [in 1908] were the unhappiest, the most difficult and yet the most fateful and productive years of my life.\" A few years before, he bought a house in Åsgårdstrand by the west coast of the Oslofjord, but spent there only a few summer months. The rest of the time the artist was preparing exhibitions and traveling around Europe, namely to Berlin, Paris, Florence, and Nice. And a few months before, he broke up with Tulla Larsen, the woman who stayed with Munch the longest. It was an exhausting passion: several happy months, and then years of quarrels, threats, escapes, partings, suicide attempts, long letters with reproaches and confessions. During that dangerous love affair, Munch began his obsessive series of Woman in Three Stages, persistently arranging sexuality, love and death in one closed cycle. The artist’s incredible productivity immediately after the break with Tulla was not accidental. He was sincerely convinced that a relationship with a woman suppressed the creativity, and that the vampire woman drew vital force and creative energy from a man. And then he was finally free. Critics say that at that time in Munch’s life started a period of \"landscapes-liberations, landscapes inhabited by innocent people, and landscapes, in which there was hope that not everything loved by man was doomed to catastrophe.\"The Girls on the Bridge is an example of such artworks. The most fragile time is the summer white night, and the borderline place is the bridge connecting two segments of the land above the dense water column of the fjord. And for the first time in a long time, Munch did not see the ghost of inevitable death over the three girls, high school students, whom he noticed during his walk and asked to pose for him. The calm nighttime, Norwegian sun closes unreliable skies for a while - and the threat recedes. The artist would return to the lulling silence of this moment 12 times in his picturesque canvases, and dozens of times would repeat it in his lithographs.Author: Anna Sidelnikova"},{"paintingTitle":"A self-portrait.

O’Keeffe knew she wanted to be an artist from a very young age. After finishing boarding school, where she received formal lessons in painting, O’Keeffe attended the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-institution/school-of-the-art]Art Institute of Chicago[/url] to become an art teacher. At the beginning of the 20th century, being a teacher was the sole approach a woman could have into the art world in the United States. Her first job as a teacher was at a small women’s college in South Carolina. Here, O’Keeffe created the charcoal pieces that caught the attention of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/alfred-stieglitz]Alfred Stieglitz[/url].\n \nStieglitz was a famous photographer, and a renowned advocate for the Modernist movement in the arts. Modernism came to the United States through the work of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso]Pablo Picasso[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/henri-matisse]Henri Matisse[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne]Paul Cézanne[/url], and other vanguard painters. In New York City, Stieglitz owned Gallery 291, acknowledged for showing the pieces of these painters. The first time an O’Keeffe drawing was exposed in public was in 1916 at this gallery. Incidentally, she was the first American painter featured at this place. During a great part of her life, she was mentored and influenced by Stieglitz. Thanks to his support, O’Keeffe left the classrooms to finally become an artist. His attention extended throughout all her career; he organized 22 solo exhibitions and several group installations. They became lovers in 1918 and stayed together until Stieglitz´s death in 1946.\n \nO’Keeffe is widely recognized for her technique and themes. She mastered the use of line and composition to create abstract pieces full of simplicity, such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/georgia-o-keeffe/drawing-xiii-1915][i]Drawing XIII[/i][/url] (1915). During the 1920’s, O’Keeffe started experimenting with vibrant colors to create depictions of flowers and landscapes. Some of her most distinguished paintings were made in this decade: [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/georgia-o-keeffe/blue-and-green-music][i]Blue and Green Music[/i][/url](1921), [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/georgia-o-keeffe/black-iris-1][i]Black Iris III[/i][/url] (1926), and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/georgia-o-keeffe/radiator-building][i]Radiator Building – Night, New York[/i][/url] (1927). An important part of her life as an artist was spent in New Mexico. There, she felt keen to portray deserts, mountains, and also skulls of animals that represented for her an eternal beauty of the desert. Juxtaposition of these elements was O’Keeffe’s approach to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/surrealism]Surrealism[/url]. \n\nIn the 1930s, people of the United States were redefining the “American lifestyle.” Pieces like [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/georgia-o-keeffe/cows-skull-red-white-and-blue-1931][i]Cow’s Skull: Red, White and Blue[/i][/url] (1931) represented O’Keeffe’s view on the subject. For her, the true image of America went far beyond the limits of big cities. During the last decades of her life, the artist was working on challenging projects like the 24-foot long canvas of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/georgia-o-keeffe/by-series/sky-above-clouds][i]Sky Above Clouds[/i][/url] series (1965–1967).\n\nO’Keeffe never wanted to be considered just a \"woman artist,\" and indeed, she surpassed this concept. By abstracting the natural world, O’Keeffe created images that have become a part of the mythology and iconography of the American artistic landscape. The majority of her works is preserved by [i]The Georgia O’Keeffe Museum[/i].","story":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_O'Keeffe","gender":"female","relatedArtistsIds":[],"popularPaintings":[{"paintingTitle":"Ram's Head, White Hollyhock-Hills","artistName":"O'Keeffe Georgia","artistContentId":231599,"paintingContentId":231821,"paintingInfo":"1935","paintingImageUrl":"ram-s-head-white-hollyhock-hills-1935","paintingDescription":"Georgia O’Keeffe maintained a great admiration for the Southwest part of the United States. In the mid-1920s, O’Keeffe felt doubts about the paintings she were doing; she wrote in a letter to a friend: “I do not seem to be crystallizing anything this winter. I am not clear. I am not steady on my feet.” Her relationship with [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/alfred-stieglitz]Alfred Stieglitz[/url] deteriorated and she was suffering health problems. O’Keeffe wanted to take a break from New York, so in 1929, she departed to visit New Mexico. This decision was just the beginning of a powerful romance that lasted until her death.\n \nDuring her travels, O’Keeffe wrote: “I never feel at home in the East like I do out here. And finally feeling in the right place again –I feel like myself– and I like it.” She resided in the West till the summer of 1930, and produced over 30 paintings there. But it was not until 1935 that she painted [i]Ram’s Head, White Hollyhock-Hills[/i].\n \nThis artwork distills much of the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/precisionism]Precisionism[/url], and also of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/surrealism]Surrealism[/url]. The juxtaposition of a skull and the landscape of New Mexico was something never seen before. For O’Keeffe, those bones became an important subject to depict in her pieces because they represented the lasting beauty of the desert and the toughness of the American spirit. It seems like the blue of the sky stands out even more than the skull and the white hollyhock. The hollyhock creates a contrast impossible to ignore. If the skull and the mountains represent the American strength, the white hollyhock may symbolize the fertility of this landscape. Despite feeling terribly miscomprehended before for her flower paintings, O’Keeffe returned continuously to them as subjects.\n \nThe hills were quite a challenge to paint for her; O’Keeffe wrote about this: “I had looked out on the hills for weeks and painted them again and again —had climbed and ridden over them— so beautifully soft, so difficult. I had painted those hills from the car in bright sunlight and had failed dismally but I could see them—farther away—from my window in the rain.

Associated most of all with pioneering [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/cubism]Cubism[/url], he also invented [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-media/collage]collage[/url] and made major contribution to [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/surrealism]Surrealism[/url]. He saw himself above all as a painter, yet his sculpture was greatly influential, and he also explored areas as diverse as printmaking and ceramics. Finally, he was a famously charismatic personality, the leading figure in the [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/cole-de-paris]Ecole de Paris[/url]. His many relationships with women not only filtered into his art but also may have directed its course, and his behavior has come to embody that of the bohemian modern artist in the popular imagination.\n\nPicasso rejected [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/henri-matisse]Matisse's[/url] view of the primary importance and role of colour, and focused instead on new pictorial ways of representing form and space. Influenced by novelties of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-cezanne]Cézanne[/url], and also by African sculpture and ancient Iberian art, he started to lend his figures more structure, and to deconstruct the conventions of perspective that had dominated painting since the Renaissance. This led him (alongside with Georges [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/georges-braque]Braque[/url]) to evolve an entirely new Cubist movement, which rapidly became the cutting edge of modern art. At the same time, Picasso himself rejected the label \"Cubism,\" especially when critics began to differentiate between the two key approaches he pursued - [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/analytical-cubism]Analytic[/url] and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/synthetic-cubism]Synthetic[/url].\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s Picasso adopted a neoclassical figurative style. As he matured he worked on his own versions of canonical masterpieces by artists such as [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/nicolas-poussin]Poussin[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jean-auguste-dominique-ingres]Ingres[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-velazquez]Velazquez[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/francisco-goya]Goya[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/rembrandt]Rembrandt[/url], and [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/el-greco]El Greco[/url].\n\nPicasso's influence was profound and far-reaching for most of his life. His work in pioneering Cubism established a set of pictorial problems, devices, and approaches, which remained important well into the 1950s. The Museum of Modern Art in New York (MoMA) has been called \"the house that Pablo built,\" because it has so widely exhibited the artist's work. Picasso created some of the greatest 20th century paintings, several of which have achieved iconic status ([url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/the-girls-of-avignon-1907]Les Demoiselles d'Avignon[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/guernica-1937]Guernica[/url], [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/crying-woman-1937-1]Weeping Woman[/url]).","story":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Picasso","gender":"male","relatedArtistsIds":[],"popularPaintings":[{"paintingTitle":"Portrait of the artist's mother","artistName":"Pablo Picasso","artistContentId":223667,"paintingContentId":"a8af4dc0-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1896, 50×39 cm • Pastel, Paper","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1200/work/74e/189916.jpg","paintingDescription":"There is still no description of this artwork.

Around 16:30 began a two hour bombardment of the German Legion \"Condor\". It was followed by a large-scale fire, turning Guernica into ruins. According to various sources, the bombardment claimed the lives of several hundred to several thousand people. Worst of all is the fact that most of the victims were women and children, since most of the male population at that time was involved in the fighting of the Spanish Civil war. Tragic news from the homeland are unable to leave Picasso has repeatedly stated his apolitical, indifferent. At that time the artist worked on a canvas for the Spanish pavilion at the upcoming world exhibition in Paris. After learning about the bombing of Guernica, the artist instantly changes the concept and takes on a new painting, which became one of the most powerful artistic and political statements in history.\"Guernica\"Picasso became a perpetual reminder of the horrors of war and one of the most famous anti-war symbols. A monumental painting measuring about four by eight meters, was written in record time (work on the painting took Picasso's little more than a month - from 1 may to 4 June), featuring not abstract heroes on the battlefield, whose exploits will be sung repeatedly. Picasso writes of ordinary people, whose names do not write in the history books, but they at all times become the true victims of any war. The artist chose to \"Guernica\" a black and white palette, and even pure white here, there is only different shades of gray. For Picasso the world, which saw a wheel war is a world without colors, the world I left behind life itself.There are many interpretations of the paintings, which are often at odds with each other. In particular, this applies to the depicted on the canvas of a bull and a horse. Some critics argued that the painting should not be taken as a political statement, since the image of the bull or the Minotaur symbolizes here in the first place the ego of Picasso himself. However, commenting on the painting, the artist said that the bull is the evil and cruelty which embodiment before and during the Second World war was fascism. According to Picasso's wounded horse represents the residents of Guernica, the victims and the victims in the massacre. But, despite the obvious gloom of the canvas and the horror that it inspires, the artist leaves his characters and the viewer hope in the form of peacefully burning lamp under the shade.

Despite the fact that he has such a long history, such as wine, absinthe has earned the right to be called a unique phenomenon in world culture. \"The green fairy\" (or, according to Paul Verlaine, \"the green witch\") sang, among others, Arthur Rimbaud, Oscar Wilde, Ernest Hemingway, immortalized in their paintings of Edgar Degas, Edouard Manet, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Vincent van Gogh and others (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). But when it comes to talking about the attitude of this drink to painting, to mind almost comes first \"The absinthe drinker\" Pablo Picasso.The young Spaniard was lucky to live in Paris in a time when it was possible to fully taste all the delights of Bohemian life, including trips to brothels in the company of impoverished artists and unhindered use of absinthe. But in the French capital, Picasso will move only in 1904, but in the meantime he shuttles regularly between Paris and Barcelona, working hard, and suffering from lack of money and insecurity. \"The absinthe drinker\" is born precisely in this period, which at all desire can not be called happy. In 1903 Picasso will write \"Portrait of angel Fernandez de Soto\"whose character is depicted at a table before a glass of absinthe. In 1912, the artist will once again perpetuate a drink in a cubist work \"Bottle of Pernod and glass\". And finally, in 1914, a year before \"the green fairy\" was banned in France, Picasso creates a sculpture \"Glass of absinthe\". Prior to the legalization of the drink in European countries, the artist did not survive.\"The absinthe drinker\" is not an original story. Lonely people in the café to Picasso and, after him, was depicted by many artists. However, it was performed by the Spanish artist, this trivial scene takes on the imprint of great drama. In the paintings \"blue period\"Picasso repeatedly to depict people, like the heroine of this painting (\"Two acrobats (harlequin and his girlfriend)\", 1901, \"Woman with chignon\", 1901, \"A man and a woman at the table\", 1903).

The artist almost recovered from the suicide of his friend Casagemas, and brightness finally entered his life. Changes occurred gradually, and the more joyful moments Picasso experienced, the more life appeared in his works. First of all, this affected the color scheme of the paintings: warm, muted colors, red, pink, orange and brown replaced the cold shades of blue and grey. However, Picasso preferred pink, which gave the name to the new period in his work.\nPicasso’s Girl On The Ball can be called a kind of synthesis of the blue and pink periods. In a surprising way, it combines the elusive anxiety of the first, and the easy serenity of the second. It is like a clash of the past and the future at one point, a visible transformation of Picasso’s creative methods and techniques. The contradiction is enhanced by using two different color palettes and opposing the main subjects of the picture.\nThe young gymnast girl wearing close bluish-grey tights, seems to be the continuation of the ball on which she balances, the curves of her body repeat its form. While the instability of her pose is more like a game, she seems to float in the air, barely touching the ball with her toes. In contrast, the athlete, pictured in the foreground, practically grows in the ground. The imposing cube on which he sits and the angular, powerful figure of the man literally turn him into the personification of stability. However, there is an invisible link between the characters of the canvas, despite all their dissimilarity, accentuated with the help of color. In the end, it becomes clear that they both constitute an ideal harmony of equilibrium, where one is impossible without the other."},{"paintingTitle":"Jacqueline with flowers","artistName":"Pablo Picasso","artistContentId":223667,"paintingContentId":"a8af4dc5-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1954, 100×81 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/orig/work/f82/190422.jpg","paintingDescription":"Pablo Picasso and Jacqueline Roque had lived together for almost 20 years until his death, and during this time he wrote about 400 her portraits.

Most of her portraits painted in a recognizable style of late Picasso painting \"Jacqueline with flowers\" - one of the most striking works of this period. Most often, the artist portrayed his second wife that's right: in profile, with huge almond-shaped eyes, and unnaturally long neck and triangular cat-like face (1, 2).It was, incidentally, the favorite pose of her for posing.

In Spain, the native country of the artist, already raging war, under the impression which Picasso wrote his \"Guernica\". Some critics believe that \"Weeping woman\" is its continuation.Presumably, the model for the painting was the painter's lover — Dora Maar. It was for Picasso his \"Weeping woman\" embodied all the pain of mothers and wives who lost their loved ones in the flames of war. Dora was the daughter of Croatian architect and was also a professional photographer. On her pictures is dominated by clochard, cripples and beggars; removing them, Dora has created a kind of surreal photopost, where beauty was combined with the deformity, and luxury to poverty. Picasso met Dora in a period of creative crisis, found in her his Muse, which became for him an intellectual outlet and helped to find their own style.

Picasso this surrealist - period,including \"Nude in a red armchair\"distinguish flowing \"melted\" contours and remarkably candid, even shocking depiction of the female form. However, Picasso never considered himself to the movement of the Surrealists: his personality and some earthiness did not allow him to submit to their favorite Freudian concept of the superiority of the unconscious. However, related to surrealism, the Dada, still believed the artist's \"own\", they published a reproduction Les demoiselles d'avignonin his Manifesto of 1925, thus acknowledging his influence on their work.The painting \"Nude in a red armchair\" was completed in may 1929. While Surrealists took the idea of what is ugly and repulsive images can pave the way to the unconscious. The picture quite clearly designed to shock the audience, according to one version, was written under the influence Salvador Daliand Joan Miro. Other critics see the choice of color and pattern Wallpaper on the background of a kind of mockery of the work Henri Matisse. All converge only in one: the canvas depicts the Russian wife of Picasso – a former dancer Olga Khokhlovathe relationship of the artist with which at that time was already on the verge of breaking. Special indignation of the painting caused among feminists. They had accused Picasso that his work depicting the female body as a symbol of submission and humiliation (hard to argue, given how evolved the relationship of the artist with all his women). Here, the depersonalization and devaluation reaches its climax: according to critics, the mouth of the heroine of the picture more like a sexual organ, topped with predatory teeth. The sharp contrast between red and green and emphasized the calm sea outside the window only reinforce the feeling of tension that fills the room.It is believed that the negative influence on the work of Picasso had a breakup with Olga, and an affair with a 17-year-old Marie-Therese Walter.

That was where the real life! Creative freedom, the first solo exhibition in the famous cafe \"Four cat\" and like-minded friends with whom you can discuss art and go on a binge in the brothels. The closest of them was the same age as Picasso, artist Carlos Casagemas. They were practically inseparable, and Pablo tried to support a friend suffering from unrequited love. But all has ended tragically: Carlos tried to shoot a girl who didn't reciprocate, after which he committed suicide.After this sad event in the works of Picasso starts permeated with the melancholy \"blue period\". The artist for the rest of his days blaming himself for his friend's death and believed that they could prevent the suicide of Casagemas. In 1901, he paints several paintings, depicting Carlos in the coffin (1, 2), but critics find similar facial features and the heroes of the later paintings of Picasso. Whatever it was, the death of a friend affected the artist so much that he escaped only by work, splashing on the canvas of depression and despair. Almost all the paintings \"blue period\" carry this invisible imprint of death. Was no exception and Picasso \"The old guitarist\".At first glance, this work creates the impression that a blind musician is depicted at the moment when he quietly breathed his last before he could finish the song until the end. He's spooky, almost merging with the background, his unnatural bent shape sheared off or the agony of death, and an agony of longing. Dark colors only enhances this effect. Alive on the canvas seems just a guitar: the viewer almost hears a shrill, gut-wrenching soul inside out chords. It is noteworthy that in \"the Old guitarist\" under a layer of paint emerges a ghostly woman's face. At that period Picasso was not always able to find the money for a new canvas, so I was forced to write one picture on top of another.In 1937 the American poet Wallace Stevens wrote the poem \"the man with the blue guitar,\" which is considered the dedication of \"the Old guitarist\". The poetic dialogue between the musician and his listeners Wallace gives in words the belief of Picasso that art is a lie that helps us see the truth.Author: Eugene Sidelnikov"},{"paintingTitle":"Portrait of Ambroise Vollard","artistName":"Pablo Picasso","artistContentId":223667,"paintingContentId":"a8af4dca-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1910, 93×65 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1200/work/0a4/277827.jpeg","paintingDescription":"Ambroise Vollard was one of the greatest art dealers of the 20th century. In different years, he supported Cézanne, Van Gogh, Renoir, Gauguin and Matisse. After Picasso had moved to Paris and began to work there, he got under Vollard’s wing. Vollard sold the paintings of the blue and pink periods, but he was rather sceptical and cautious about the Cubist works by Picasso. Later, when the artist returned to the figurative painting, the art dealer made him a very tempting offer. In exchange for several paintings by Renoir and Cézanne, the artist made 100 etchings, mostly mythological and erotic, united into the Vollard Suite. It took seven years for Picasso to complete them in 1937, two more years were spent to print 230 full copies of the series. However, in 1939, Vollard died in a car crash, and the beginning of the Second World War postponed the final release of the Suite for another ten years.Picasso once said, “The most beautiful woman who ever lived never had her portrait painted, drawn, or engraved more often than Vollard – by Cézanne, Renoir, Rouault, Bonnard... But my cubist portrait of him is the best of all.” This self-confident statement flattered not only the artist himself, but, in fact, also Vollard. Some art critics believe that the manner in which Picasso portrayed the art dealer, implies the presence of Vollard’s remarkable mind, which makes him part of an elite group that understands Cubism. The huge head of the man in the picture is like a broken egg, repeated multiple times, consisting of many fragments; it rises like a massive dome over the body. According to Picasso’s vision, only such a head was capable of accommodating Vollard’s outstanding brain.The Portrait of Ambroise Vollard reminds of a monumental architectural structure, moulded from dissimilar shards of irregular shape.

Prior to that, he visited the capital of European art three times, where he brought his paintings, trying to sell them, but each time he was in for a cruel disappointment. Going to Paris, Picasso was confident that critics and viewers would instantly appreciate his undeniable genius. However, the paintings were not sold for some reason. The critics took the works of the young Spaniard favorably, but they noted the lack of his individual style. The artist was terribly offended, and it can be said that all his further creative searches and experiments were a struggle for this very individuality and proof of his uniqueness.The main themes of the blue period in the work of Picasso were poverty, hunger and suffering. He painted people caught in the underclass, unhappy, maimed and desperate. In fact, in these works, the artist expressed his own privations: during his life in Paris, he suffered from lack of money, he had nowhere to live, and sometimes he had nothing to eat. His depressed state was aggravated by the loss of his close friend Carlos Casagemas, who committed suicide because of unhappy love. The Old Jew and a Boy picture can be called the embodiment of all the Picasso’s sufferings of those years. Here we can see the climax of the triumph of blue shades, the artist only slightly dilutes them with yellow to emphasize the painful pallor of the characters’ skin.The hungry face of the old man and his distorted proportions make one recall the subjects of El Greco’s paintings. However, there is something much more important behind the sensation of grief and despair: the characters of the picture are not alone, even in poverty and hunger they find the strength to support each other. During his life in Barcelona, often wandering around the local shantytowns, Picasso surely saw impoverished Jews and empathized with them. Perhaps that’s why he chose the image of the Jewish old man for this powerful work. In the 1990s, American writer and journalist Norman Mailer pointedly defined this picture quite precisely in his biographical book Portrait of Picasso as A Young Man, “Who has ever given us more intense portraits of concentration camp victims before half of them were even born?”"},{"paintingTitle":"Cans and bowls","artistName":"Pablo Picasso","artistContentId":223667,"paintingContentId":"a8af4dcc-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1908, 66×50.5 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1200/work/950/200573.jpg","paintingDescription":"There is still no description of this artwork.

She was a tall red-haired beauty, instantly attracting attention and more hothead than ardent young Spaniards. In the future, by the way, Picasso would take mostly low and submissive women as his life partners. Relationship of Pablo and Fernanda lasted seven years. They were stormy, full of jealousy and even violence. But all this only fueled the artist’s inspiration, and he painted his beloved a lot and did it passionately.Fernanda frequently visited Bateau-Lavoir, a building inhabited by young poor artists, because she earned her living by sitting. Fate was not very supportive to her: she was an illegitimate child, brought up by her mother and uncle, who planned to marry the girl when she grew up. She escaped from the house and married a man who was cruel to her. The girl again had to flee: at the age of 19 she moved to Paris and changed her name so that her husband could not find her. Here she quickly got acquainted with artists and writers and made friends with Guillaume Apollinaire. A few years later, Fernanda met Picasso, and from that time, he claimed the exclusive right to paint her portraits. They never got married, because officially Olivier was still married.It wasn’t that easy to be Picasso’s muse. Bright and beautiful Fernanda, accustomed to the admiration reflected in the pictures of other artists, hardly understood the style experiments of Picasso. With the beginning of their relationship, the blue period in his work transformed into pink, but gradually the conventionally classical figurative painting began to recede into the background, the shapes in Picasso’s works increasingly simplified, and the proportions were distorted. Fernanda had to put up with the mismatch: on the one hand, she had her own idea of her appearance, on the other were Pablo’s fantasies. She experienced both the African period and Les Demoiselles d’Avignon. The Lady With a Fan portrait appeared at the time of the next transformation, during the transition to pure Cubism.Approximately at the same time, the relationship between Fernanda and Pablo began to crumble. In 1907, Olivier took a 13-year-old orphan from the orphanage, but they did not get a full-fledged family, and the girl was sent back. When Picasso tasted the advent of success, he began to lose interest in Fernanda, because she was a living reminder of the difficult times. In 1912, they broke up, and the woman had to change many low-paid jobs in order to feed herself. Twenty years later, Fernanda wrote memoirs about living together with Picasso, which were published in a major Belgian newspaper in 1930, in parts. The artist, who was already at the height of his popularity then, hired lawyers to prevent the publication. As a result, Picasso achieved his goal, and Olivier received major compensation."},{"paintingTitle":"Farmer","artistName":"Pablo Picasso","artistContentId":223667,"paintingContentId":"a8af4dce-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1908, 81.5×65.5 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1200/topic_history/a15/200578.jpg","paintingDescription":"There is still no description of this artwork.

The impression that plenty of \"playing\" with cubism, examining its length and breadth, the artist returned to figurative painting and refers to neo-classical techniques and subjects. In the early 20-ies in his paintings begin to appear monumental figures that Gertrude Stein jokingly dubbed \"big women\" (1, 2, 3, 4). Picture \"Two women running on the beach\" can be called, perhaps, the most famous work of this series.Picasso refuses favorite technique - the distortion of the proportions of the human body, but now this technique takes other forms. His new heroine is not like any torn and withered sufferers \"blue\" period nor translucent, air comedians \"pink\" nor stone pile geometric shapes, no fluid surreal form. If we use the analogy with the elements, the \"large woman\" is the Earth in its purest form. Despite the feeling of complete freedom and emancipation, the heroine of this picture don't look like hovering above the ground. They seem to stand on it as firmly, although it is actually barely touching her. Bright blue shades of sea and sky, the flowing hair of women, their tightly knit, resilient, amazing \"material\" of the body – all this gives the feeling of such fullness of life, which only people can experience. This, according to some critics, is the main message most post-war paintings, Picasso: that's the way you live, that's the way you feel-not about war horrors.It is believed that a major influence on the works of Picasso in this period had the events in his personal life. \"Large women\" began to appear in his paintings in a time when the artist's wife Olga Khokhlova was pregnant with his first child. Researchers believe that the impressive female body was a kind of celebration of motherhood and fertility.In 1924 the painting \"Two women running on the beach\", increased nearly 30 times, was used in the design of performances of Russian ballet of Diaghilev \"Blue train\".

The portrait was created in December 1937, becoming the culmination of perhaps the most intense year in the life of the artist. Five months earlier, he created his greatest masterpiece — \"Guernica\"dedicated to the bombing of the eponymous town during the civil war in Spain. Although Picasso still continued relationship with Walter, an increasingly significant position in his life conquered another woman — Dora Maar, with whom Rodin met in 1935.It seems that through this portrait, Picasso was trying to Express their feelings towards both women. This duality is visible in the transition of the two styles — more soft, festive feel \"of the period, Marie-thérèse\" gives way to more painful cubist forms associated with politically minded Dora Maar (1937 in the same year she posed for «Weeping woman»that is now part of the collection of the Tate Modern in London).For the face of Marie-thérèse on \"Women take\" silhouette emerges, in which the artist could mean your next lover. Picasso himself said: \"The girl must be painful to see the picture that her time is running out».It is interesting to compare the evolution of portraits of Walter over the past few years. In 1932, Picasso created an extraordinarilysensual and lyrical images his lover, indicating the peak of happiness. But a dynamic \"Woman in a beret and plaid dress\" shows how much has changed in five years. Sharp cubist borders, paint, imposed rough brush strokes and black outlines give the work a strong emotional charge. This is not the voluptuous curves and smooth curves, which Picasso painted the woman who gave birth to his child. However, the portrait suggests that she still occupies a Central place in the life of the artist.More than 80 years since the creation of \"Woman in a beret and plaid dress\" did not appear on the market. After the artist's death in 1973, she moved to a private collection and only in February of 2018 was put up for sale the works of the Impressionists and modernists Sotheby's in London.

She was also a painter, speaking in his native Spanish, and shared his political views. Maar even helped Picasso in the creation of his monumental paintings \"Guernica\" and was the only person captured on film the process of writing this famous painting. It was not so much a mistress, but the intellectual power that inspired Picasso to the creation of many powerful and daring portraits. And one of them \"Dora Maar with cat\" - is among the most famous works of the artist.Most of the portraits of Dora Maar in a similar technique: Picasso wrote them in a deliberately distorted manner and it's a dark color, duplicated and multiplied parts of the face and body of his beloved, made them jagged and angular (1, 2, 3). It is considered that the style of his letters was severely affected by the unfolding at that time in Europe the Second World war. Picasso and Maar met in 1936 and lived together until the end of the war in Nazi-occupied Paris, and, according to critics, the artist it is seen then the world is distorted and broken. The painting \"Dora Maar with cat\" was written in 1941, when the war began in France.When you create a portrait of Dora Maar seated in a chair with a kitten on his shoulder, Picasso used unusual for this period, a surprisingly bright color palette and showed amazing attention to detail. He portrayed a lover like either some kind of pagan goddess, proudly seated on a throne, or a witch with a sly glance, ready to cast a spell. The similarities emphasize the pointed hat of a woman and her long, predatory nails. And, of course, it is difficult to imagine a self-respecting witch without a black cat. By the way, that flawless manicure and exquisite hats were a kind of \"calling card\" of Dora Maar and the special pride. \"Dora Maar with cat\" was sold in 2006 at Sotheby's anonymous collector for 95,2 million dollars, and is still in the list of most expensive works of art in history.Author: Eugene Sidelnikov"}],"rangePaintings":null},{"contentId":184856,"artistName":"Jackson Pollock","url":"jackson-pollock","lastNameFirst":"Pollock Jackson ","birthDay":"/Date(-1828051200000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-422582400000)/","birthDayAsString":"28 January 1912","deathDayAsString":"11 August 1956","image":"https://uploads3.wikiart.org/images/paul-jackson-pollock.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Pollock","periodsOfWork":"Early works\r\nDrip period\r\nLate works","series":"","activeYearsStart":1934,"activeYearsCompletion":1953,"biography":"Deemed the “greatest painter alive” during his lifetime, Jackson Pollock was an American painter who was a major artist abstract expressionist art in the 20th century. Pollock was expelled from two high schools during his formative years, the second one being Los Angeles Manual Arts School, where he was encouraged to pursue his interest in art. In 1930, he moved to New York to study art, and secured a job under the WPA Federal Art Project, a New Deal project, which allowed him to earn a living from his painting. \r\n\r\nAs he was gaining professional and social success, Pollock fought the addiction of alcoholism and recurring bouts of depression. Two of his brothers suggested Jungian psychotherapy, with Dr. Joseph Henderson, who encouraged Pollock in his artistic endeavors as part of his therapy. Although the psychotherapy did not cure his drinking, it did expose him to Jungian concepts, which he expressed in his paintings at the time. In 1945, Pollock moved with his wife and American painter Lee Krasner to Springs, New York, where he would remain the rest of his life. In the barn behind the house, which he converted to his studio, Pollock developed a new and completely novel technique of painting using what he called his “drip” technique. Using hardened brushes, sticks, and turkey basters, and household enamel paints, Pollock squirted, splashed, and dripped his paint onto canvas rolled out over his studio floor. In 1956, Time magazine gave Pollock the name “Jack the Dripper,” referencing his unique style of action painting. \r\n\r\nRecent studies by art historians and scientists have determined that some of Pollock’s work display properties of mathematical fractals, asserting that his works became more fractal-like throughout his career. In his later paintings, Pollock reduced the titles of all of his paintings to numbers, in order to reduce the viewers attempt to indentify any representational element in his paintings. Pressured by his growing fame and demand from art collectors, Pollock’s alcoholism worsened. In August of 1956, while driving under the influence of alcohol, he was involved in a single–car accident, killing himself and one of his passengers. Pollock’s legacy was secured by his widow, Lee Krasner, who managed his estate after his death. His legacy includes a number of references in social media, including songs, poems, books, and documentaries, and the feature film biopic Pollock, directed by and starring Ed Harris.

In 1943, Guggenheim signed with the artist's contract, promising to organize his personal exhibition in November. He in turn planned by this time to finalize \"Mural\". A close friend of Peggy artist Marcel Duchamp recommended to paint a mural not on the wall, but on canvas, to make it mobile and transportable.To stretch the canvas the desired size, Pollock had to destroy the wall between the two rooms. Peggy gave him complete freedom in the story of linen, and equipment, and materials. And for weeks the artist was just sitting in the Studio staring at a \"huge, but very exciting\" blank canvas, not having a clue about what to portray.Time was running out, Guggenheim began to put pressure on Pollock, requiring to execute the order. And finally \"Fresco\" took his seat in the house galeristka. According to the artist, he was inspired by a sudden vision: \"It was an escape of all the animals of the American West cows and horses and antelopes and bulls\".There is a legend according to which Pollock wrote this canvas in just one night. However, a recent analysis of the painting showed that it was not created in one week, since some of the paint was already dry when I applied the new (and in the case of oil paints this process takes a lot of time).Marcel Duchamp told me that the finished canvas delivered Pollock to the mansion Guggenheim, were too large and had to be cut to fit on the wall.

There is a perception that the artist wrote of his paintings under jazz, dancing around the canvas with a can of paint at the ready. Of course, Pollock was a great lover of jazz music and has assembled an impressive collection, but he never turned those records in the Studio. At least because a large part of his life there was no electricity.Spreading the canvas on the floor, the artist has obtained full freedom of movement and the ability to apply paint to the canvas. And this was particularly important when dealing with such vast spaces, which he loved to deal with Pollock (observers believe that this love was largely due to childhood memories of endless Savannah and the Grand Canyon). For example, the painting \"Autumn rhythm\" has a simply stunning size – more than 2.5 to 5 meters. The uniqueness of this work, as well as many other paintings by the artist, is that she is an incredibly fascinating sight from a distance and up close. Depending on the vagaries of the imagination of the viewer, it can be seen curved in the dance of the human body, the ghostly figures of animals and mysterious symbols, hidden in the depths.\"Autumn rhythm\" creates a sense of lightness and spontaneity, but this impression is deceptive.

Of course, if it really is written in his hand. Canvas \"Red, black and silver\" was the subject of years of war between the artist's mistress, Ruth Kligman and his widow Lee Krasner. Kligman claimed that this was the last written by Pollock before his death. Moreover, he wrote on her eyes, and when the painting was completed, gave her beloved with the words: \"Here's your painting, your very own Pollock\". Krasner insisted that the artist really stopped writing long before death, and this painting is nothing more than a fake, and not very skillful.Until recently, to verify the authenticity of the painting had no chance. Krasner created the Council involved in establishing the authenticity of the paintings of Pollock, still did not recognize the artist by the author of this work. In favor of their conclusion says that the painting is not signed and created in an unusual Pollock colours. Kligman, who over a lifetime have contributed to his \"don Juan list\" a lot of famous painters, until his death in 2010, fought with the Council, proving the authenticity of the picture. And only now, when all the participants of this history have already gone to the other world, with the help of independent forensic examination failed to evidence linking Pollock's work \"Red, black and silver\". Forensic expert Nicolas Petraco, who studied the picture found it is not only wool polar bear rug from the house of the artist and the soil particles, typical for the area but also the hair of the Pollock. According to Petraco, these findings are more than convincing. Whatever it was, the fate of the painting has not been resolved so far.

At the beginning of his artistic career, he mostly wrote in the style of realism, albeit with a fair amount expressive (one of the most famous of his works of that period – \"The West\", 1934). After a four-month stay in a new York psychiatric hospital for alcoholics in 1938, the artist turned to abstract art and surrealism. And finally, the third period came after the invention of the \"drip\" technique in the late 40's. Canvas \"She-wolf\" refers to the second period when Pollock are seriously interested in the ideas of psychoanalysis and Jungian archetypes and drew inspiration from Indian mythology, creating an image of the artist-mystic, a shaman with a brush, prints on canvas the mysterious symbols and images of totem animals.\"She-wolf\" was first presented to the public at the first exhibition of Jackson Pollock in 1943. The plot saw the reference to the legend about the founders of Rome, Romulus and Remo, reared by a she-wolf. However, the artist himself has refused to comment on this, and other works. He only said that this picture \"is there because I was supposed to draw\". And added: \"Any attempt on my part to say anything about it, any attempt to explain the inexplicable can only destroy\".The wolf is a powerful feminine archetype and strong mythological image, sung in a variety of American folk tales and legends perpetuated and, in particular, in the famous book \"Running with the wolves\" by Clarissa Estes Pinkola. \"She-wolf\" Pollock, written in the dark tones of the rough strokes of black and white paint, searchingly staring at the viewer through the canvas covering the pattern of color symbols and hieroglyphic hints, inspires an almost primitive awe of the force of nature is meaningful and inexplicable.Author: Eugene Sidelnikov"},{"paintingTitle":"The grey rainbow","artistName":"Jackson Pollock","artistContentId":184856,"paintingContentId":"a9164d03-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1953, 182.9×244.2 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/orig/work/8e7/267487.jpg","paintingDescription":"The name of this painting can be translated rather as \"the Ashen rainbow\", which is understandable, considering at what period of the artist's life the work was written. At this time Pollock started drinking again after two years of sobriety and began increasingly to fall into a state of dull anguish, and depressive despair. His marriage was unraveling, but in painting he never created anything new (despite the fact that his paintings began to sell well), risking to bump into repetition and self-replication. \"Grey rainbow\" at first glance, surprisingly accurately conveys the state in which Pollock was in the last years of his life.And only after careful consideration it is possible to detect that the painting hides a few surprises. First, the picture seems just a jumble of black and white lines on a featureless grey background. However, a closer look suddenly becomes clear that the colors on the canvas is not so simple and straightforward. First, it turns out that the white color is actually very muted orange or beige, which looks to be a completely white only the background of deep black. And in the gray bluish color visible brushstrokes. Moreover, despite the categorical title of the work, a rainbow on the canvas really is. Bright smears in the bottom part of the picture at first are lost on the General background, but as soon as they catch the eye, it becomes apparent that they constitute the basis of the plot. \"Grey rainbow\" is one of the few made in the \"drip\" technique paintings of Jackson Pollock, received a separate name, not a number. And this name perfectly reflects the features of a gloomy nature, which the artist called his work \"arrested in space memories\".Author: Eugene Sidelnikov"}],"rangePaintings":null},{"contentId":210477,"artistName":"Raphael","url":"raphael","lastNameFirst":"Raphael","birthDay":"/Date(-15368227200000)/","deathDay":"/Date(-14200704000000)/","birthDayAsString":"1483","deathDayAsString":"1520","image":"https://uploads8.wikiart.org/images/raphael.jpg!Portrait.jpg","wikipediaUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael","periodsOfWork":"","series":"Stanza della Segnatura\r\nSistine Chapel\r\nStanza dell'Eliodor","activeYearsStart":1499,"activeYearsCompletion":1520,"biography":"Considered one of great master painters, Raphael was an Italian painter and architect in the High Renaissance. Raphael, along with Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, are considered the great trinity of master painters of the High Renaissance period. He was a prolific artist, and despite death at the young age of 37, has a considerable body of work to study. \r\n\r\nRaphael was born into an artistic family, as his father was the court painter to The Duke of Urbino. After his mother’s death in 1491 and his father’s death in 1494, eleven year old Raphael, who had already shown artistic talent, played a large role in continuing his father’s painting studio. He was first described as a fully-trained master painter in 1501, roughly around the age of 19. Even at this early stage in his career, he was in high demand, and completed many commissioned works. Raphael continued to paint, traveling constantly, living the life of a semi-nomadic painter. He was able to merge the influence of Florentine art with his own developing style, creating a smooth, flowing composition, which was highly regarded.\r\n\r\nThe three great masters, Raphael, Leondardo da Vinci, and Michelangelo, were all contemporaries. Leonardo was thirty years Raphael’s senior, and the younger painter incorporated many elements of da Vinci’s paintings in to his own works. Michelangelo, on the other hand, was only eight years Raphael’s senior. Michelangelo already did not like Leonardo, and he disliked the rising popularity of Raphael even more, starting conspiracies and spreading rumors about Raphael. \r\n\r\nIn 1508, Raphael moved to Rome, where he would reside for the rest of his life. His first major work inn Rome was a commission to decorate the Pope’s private library, the Stanza della Segnatura. After he finished this room, the Pope was so pleased with his work that he assigned him to other rooms of the building, displacing other artists who had been commissioned to complete the works.

He Gonzaga?\"\nWhether Rafael is familiar with Elisabetta? Unlike many \"Madonnas\" and female portraits, models which have remained unknown (or, if their names history has preserved, role in the fate of the artist is either quite vague, or full of legends, in which it is difficult to distinguish truth from fiction), in the case of the model of this portrait, we can answer affirmatively: Yes, Raphael knew her very well. But to explain the circumstances in which crossed the Duchess and Rafael, you should start with his father Giovanni Santi. As son, he was born in the Italian city of Urbino. The Duke of Urbino during senior Santi was the condottiere Federico da Montefeltro – an outstanding figure of the Renaissance, military commander, politician and connoisseur of the arts. Anyone interested in paintings of the period, of course, well-remembered double portrait of the Duke of Federigo and his wife Battista Sforza by Piero della Francesca: saw time this strong-willed profile with distinct nose break, it will not soon forget. This remarkable ruler, who wanted to make of Urbino, \"ideal city\", the \"city Palace\", and was court painter Giovanni Santi, father of Raphael. The sixth child of the Duke and his wife Battista was a weak and sickly boy, Guidobaldo. He was only 10 years old when, in 1482, the year he died, federigo da Montefeltro, but it is Guidobaldo became the Duke of Urbino after his father, as all children born before him, were girls. At the National gallery of the Marche, which eventually transformed Urbino Palace, is stored dynastic portrait, which shows Federigo and his little cherubic heir of Guidobaldo. The author we do not know: first, it was thought that this Melozzo da Forli then – Justus van Gent now more or less unanimously assumed that the portrait was written by the Spaniard Pedro Berruguete. Just curious in this picture is a detailed writing of regalia: Federigo on the neck the order of the ermine, and below the knee – the order of the garter, and his little son wearing a gown, richly covered with large pearls, his brow and chest is decorated with amethysts, resembling the zodiacal symbols, and in the hands of Guidobaldo holds a scepter Gonfaloniere (in Rome, the so-called commander of the papal troops, in Florence – the head of government and the guarantor of the Constitution), although by age he is not more than five years.So, in 10 years, Guidobaldo received the Duchy, and after 6 years he was up to (or more accurately, so decided its surroundings) to marry. In bride he was chosen as our heroine – Elisabetta Gonzaga, the sister of McGrath Mantua. She was not particularly beautiful and was a little older than the young Duke da Montefeltro, but influential relatives considered it a great party, and Guidobaldo went to the bride to Mantua. Other novelists called Elisabetta \"Mature bride\" – in our times, it's funny: Guidobaldo was 16, she was 17. But if we remember how Shakespeare Paris, asking to 14-year-old Juliet, tells her doubting father, count Capulet: \"I mothers happy knew younger...\" we will understand that the fierce determination.Upon meeting Elisabetta struck groom is that high for a women, growth. It is known that after signing in Mantua all documents pertaining to the marriage contract, hill Guidobaldo decided to show off in the saddle – and very badly. Fractious horse threw him at full gallop, the Duke of Urbino returned with broken arms and ribs and cervical dislocation.However, in spite of the unfavorable omens, the big wedding of Elisabetta Gonzaga and Guidobaldo da Montefeltro took place: from different corner of Italy gathered more than five hundred noble guests, the festivities lasted deep into the night, and Giovanni Santi in honor of the holiday even written and staged three-act Comedy in verse, to which he wrote the scenery, and now was considered not just an artist, and something of the education Minister at the Ducal court. His son Raphael at this time was about six years old.\"Each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way\"\nWe were satisfied with their lot, the newly minted Duchess of Urbino? Imagine how she ended up in damaging the imagination of a magnificent castle, built charismatic Federigo, which she failed to catch. It was designed by the architect Laurana and the best engineers of his time, and advised the construction of the Leon Battista Alberti. The castle was of extraordinary beauty and functionality: the hanging gardens, halls, decorated by the famous artists, inlaid Cabinet master, a Grand throne room for receptions, and an unprecedented level of household amenities – water supply system re-purifying water, the kitchen and the glacier, restrooms, which were heated in the same way as the baths of the Ancient Rimu. It was all extremely luxury for its time. When the French philosopher Montaigne, traveling, got to Urbino, he was amazed at the scale of the Palace of Montefeltro and recorded in the travel notes that rooms and halls there are not less than days in the year.But family life Elisabetta went wrong from the beginning. Pretty soon she was disappointed in his wife. Painful, Guidobaldo (in addition to displacement of the vertebrae, he suffered from severe gout – inborn defect of metabolism, striking joints) was not able to conceive an heir. Their marriage remained childless. Perhaps that is why Elisabetta tenderly took care of the younger Raphael. Not so much because foresaw future success – rather favor to his parents: graceful Maggia, mother of Raphael, adorn the Suite of the Duchess, his father Giovanni is not only a painter and decorator, but also an organizer of all kinds of entertainments at court, including the so beloved gems. In 8 years Rafael will lose a mother, and a society of educated, intelligent, gallant, Elisabetta, Duchess of Urbino, would contribute to the education and development of his taste for poetry, susceptibility to the beautiful. When the second wife of Giovanni Santi, a daughter, Elisabetta Gonzaga agreed to be the godmother, so in her honor, half-sister of Raphael will also be named Elisabetta.For all that dedication Elisabetta husband was never in doubt. In 1497, the year of Urbino surrounded by the troops of Cesare Borgia. Stricken with gout, Guidobaldo commanded the defense of the city, defending the independence of Urbino. Because of the severe pain he could only move on a stretcher, and one day, the walls of the Duke was kidnapped by thugs Borgia and demanded for it a fantastic purchase. To save my husband, Elisabetta, hiding at that time in Mantua, sold their jewels and mortgaged hereditary allotments, and when this was not enough, took out a Bank loan at an exorbitant interest rate. Only thanks to her efforts, half-dead, the Duke returned home. And the treacherous Borgia, returning, Guidobaldo continued shamelessly Troll him, calling the \"dear Italian brother\" and sending gifts with a subtext: it was the silver barrel of oysters – a known means to increase potency, in different times – ancient sculpture of Venus and Eros. Meaning they were obviously mocking. Everyone knew about the intimate trouble of the family of Montefeltro. Relatives tried to persuade Elizabeth to divorce with her husband and more favorable Union – the Duchess did not budge.And what about Rafael?\nRafael will go to Perugia, then Florence and finally to Rome, but will be happy from time to time to come to Urbino (although there is no longer be alive, his parents) because he liked the atmosphere of the Ducal court, in a much defined personality Elisabetta. Friend of Raphael, writer and diplomat Baldassare Castiglione Elisabetta will dedicate his famous treatise \"the Court\". Playboy, Baldassare with reverence write about the Duchess of Urbino, \"chastity and dignity inherent in even her jokes and laughter\".This portrait of the 33-year-old Duchess commissioned Raphael with the purpose to send as a gift to my friend Isabella d'este another nezauryadnaya (although izvodimy their whims Leonardo and Titian) to the woman of his era, which was called la Primadonna del Rinascimento – the prima Donna of the Renaissance. She was Elisabetta, daughter – in- Isabella was married to her brother.\"In this diptych of the couple, writes the biographer of Raphael Alexander Makhov about portraits, Guidobaldo and Elisabetta, – young portrait artist managed to subtly convey the complex relationship that links this ruling childless couple who have never mutual affection, not to mention love. Smart ugly face 33-year-old Elizabeth reflects a longing for the sense of motherhood that she didn't had a chance to learn. As for the portrait of her younger spouse, it is the expression of weak will and hidden ailments, stachivaya worm his flesh. Unlike his strong-willed father, a young ruler of Urbino was a man of gentle and retiring. It is poorly understood in humans and are usually for Executive positions appointed by those who advised his wife, who played the role of a smart and caring wife-mother\".For 6 years Elisabetta Gonzaga (1471-1526) will survive Raphael (1483-1520) and by as much as 18 – my husband, Guidobaldo (1472-1508), the marriage with whom she often had to live in separation and feeling of loneliness. In distant Russia, the exhibition \"Raphael. The poetry of the image\" (September – December 2016) in the State Museum of fine arts. Pushkin, Elisabetta also came without Guidobaldo, whose portrait waited for her in the Uffizi.Author: Anna Yesterday"},{"paintingTitle":"The Sistine Madonna","artistName":"Raphael","artistContentId":210477,"paintingContentId":"a97bec91-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1513, 269.5×201 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1200/work/e70/263039.jpg","paintingDescription":"There is still no description of this artwork.

In Italy before the entry into the Euro zone this portrait printed on 500-thousand-dollar bill: on the reverse (back side) five hundred lire was located the famous Raphael's \"Athens school\", but the obverse (front side) decorated fragment of a fresco of Raphael's \"Galatea\" and the famous self-portrait.More surprising is that some critics call the controversial self-portrait, referring to the somewhat tangled history of change of ownership of the work and its poor preservation, compounded by clumsy restorations. And yet (despite the caveat that it can only be a copy from the lost original) an absolute majority of experts, no doubt – before us is Rafael and this is a self-portrait. A self-portrait of Raphael: time and place\nSelf portrait date 1504-1506 m over the years – Rafael, therefore, is not more than 22-23 years. At this time he had already done to learn from Peruginobut instead of returning to his home in Urbino with a clear prospect following his father Giovanni Santibecome the court painter of the Dukes of Urbino, a young man at your own risk of going to Florence. The heyday of Florentine art was nearing its end, but everything is still working (before imminent departure) the great elder contemporaries of Raphael – Leonardo da Vinciand Michelangeloand Rafael knows that he has a lot to learn from them. Soft light, placed on the half-turned face in this portrait, and the same soft, already lost proginosko the rigidity of the contours indicate that the lessons of painting by Leonardo have not been for Rafael's gift: he is studying intensively and preparing to conquer new frontiers in art. It seems, and the self-portrait was to perform a representative function: he demonstrated to potential customers, rich and noble Florentines, of the ability of the young painter.It will take another 5-6 years, Rafael will move from Florence to Rome will be a papal artist and in the famous fresco \"The school of Athens\"decorating the office of Pope Julius II, will write another self portraitin the company of other great – Michelangelo, Leonardo, the architect Bramante. Put yourself in this way, the youngest and least experienced, with the giants on equal terms. Auto-the image of Raphael's \"Athens school\" is very reminiscent of his early self-portrait. These are the same features – the only difference is that they are in mirror image (the mirror, by the way, was one of the favorite techniques of da Vinci).Psychology and anatomy in a self-portrait of Raphael\n\"We can safely say that he was truly an over-achiever, and quite happy person, completely loyal to the beloved, writes in the biography of Raphael the author Alexander Makhov. – It was given to him easily and without much effort. This remarkable ease he owed to his genius, which protected him from all sorts of shocks. So he looks on the famous self-portrait (Florence, Uffizi) is a confident young man with brown hair to her shoulders, regular features and enchanting eyes brown eyes in which lurks a kind of cunning\".The expression of a Raphael self-portrait interpreted in different ways. Someone, on the contrary, saw in him a directness and simple. Someone read in his eyes a bottomless sadness, akin to creative melancholy of Durer(according to the testimony of Vasari, Dürer and Raphael met once). Someone took a self-portrait of Raphael as an expression of the absolute balance and tranquility, bringing the happy character of the artist, the harmony of his paintings. Someone mentioned that the beautiful shape of the mouth of Raphael allude to its sensitivity (which is also insensitive trumpeted by Vasari), and slightly protruding lower lip gives the artist a natural stubbornness and persistence in achieving goals. But many found in the person of Rafael pleasantness, elegance, tenderness and kindness.However, all of these exercises in physiognomy – something very subjective. And for the sake of objectivity, we note that not all self-portrait of Raphael caused a delighted awe. For example, the famous English historian Edward Gibbon(1737-1794) described it as: \"Without expression, without drawing and without colour\". In addition, it was noted that the relationship between the painting of the face and neck, the wizard allows anatomical inaccuracies, is characteristic also for some other works by Raphael.A self-portrait of Raphael: grace and sprezzatura\nThe young man in the portrait is dressed simply and strictly, and at the same time elegant. From under the black robes stands a thin white stripe gate. Hair tucked under a black beret. Its graceful appearance correlated with two important concepts of Renaissance aesthetics and the Renaissance code of conduct. The first of them graceand the second sprezzatura.Beauty is impossible without harmony, but harmony knew differently. Leon Battista Alberti (scientist, priatel, art theorist of the Renaissance), for example, interpreted harmony as an ideal combination of parts. But the philosopher-Platonist Marsilio Ficino said: beauty is not only harmony, but also grace. What is grace? It is beauty in motion, \"the brightness of the whole\" presence in the body spiritualized the divine. The living embodiment of grace many called Raphael.The second concept of sprezzatura – belongs to a friend of Raphael, diplomat and humanist Of Baldassare Castiglione. In his famous treatise \"On the court\", he sings of sprezzatura – quality which successful people of the world. This ability to behave as if whatever you did and whatever made up, you don't need any special effort, everything is free of stress and difficulty. A self-portrait of Raphael, in accord with the code of Castiglione, shows the viewer before him a brilliant young artist to whom everything is extraordinary, truly divine ease. A huge talent of Raphael is not clouded, as is often the case with artists all over the history, some inward flaw. Rather, as stated by Vasari, has had a rare charm, kindness and humility – such that \"at the sight of Raphael any bad mood and any vile or evil thought out of my head\".Author: Anna Yesterday"},{"paintingTitle":"The stanza della senyatura.

I assume that the artist painted \"Madonna of Granduca\" about 1504. It was the first painting created in Florence, where a native of Urbino, Raphael came to see firsthand the works Michelangeloand Leonardo da Vinciand under their influence to improve my own technique.\"Unfortunately, unknown to the woman-mother, whose features inspired by Raphael, – wrote the biographer of Urbina Simon Brilian. – Perhaps the great artist met her in one of the villages around Florence and later in Rome, during carnival, he sketched another wonderful drawing \"Madonna della Sedia\"by putting a sheet of paper on an overturned barrel and forget the surrounding crowd, and everything\".What does the name of the picture?\nIn Italian Grand Duca means \"great Prince\" or \"Grand Duke\" and \"Madonna Granduca\" – respectively, \"Ducal Madonna,\" \"Madonna of the Grand Duke\". At the end of the XVIII century the painting purchased the great Duke of Tuscany Ferdinand III(1769-1824). It was the time of the Napoleonic wars, restless and dangerous. The Florentine Palazzo Pitti, the Ducal residence, the barbaric looting then lost many of its artistic treasures, including paintings by Raphael, and the Duke Ferdinand III, fled to Vienna. There and caught him in the late autumn of 1799 a letter from the Director of the Uffizi Tommaso Puccini. He excitedly reported that he had met recently, one of the Florentine merchant well-preserved early \"Madonna\" by Raphael and begged the Duke to give permission to buy it. Ferdinand III agreed and never regretted. On the contrary: the Duke was to his purchase extremely attached to. \"Madonna Granduca\" not only hung in his bedroom – she was always accompanied by Ferdinand III on the way. When the Duke went into exile in würzburg, Raphael went with him. However, not the fact that Ferdinand, whose title gave the painting its present title, saw in her the value of art – rather, \"Granduca\" has become something of its mascot. Some believed the image of the miraculous.In the beginning of the XIX century painting was updated restorer Vittorio Sampieri. From 1821 to 1830-th \"Granduca\" was temporarily transferred to the Uffizi gallery, and then returned to the Palatine gallery, part of Palazzo Pitti, where it is stored now (though recently, the \"Uffizi gallery\" formally include the Palatine gallery).What artistic merits \"of the Madonna of Granduca\"?\nThe composition of the painting, at first glance, extremely simple. But this is difficult to achieve high simplicity, which is more valuable than contrived complexity. Generational depicts the virgin Mary holding a nearly naked Baby, clinging to the hands of the mother's shoulder and chest. He looks at the audience intently and Mature, while Maria shyly and timidly lowers her eyes. There's still some stiffness of the young painter in the transfer of POS (some noticed that the Baby in this position \"awkward\"), but the way the figure of Mary is slightly tilted to the left, balanced by a reversal of the baby Jesus in the opposite direction, leaves the impression of an amazing balance of volumes and masses, and the rare art of compactness and harmony. My half-closed eyes Mary, her timidity and delicacy infect the viewer with a sense of humility before the inevitability of all that is destined to be.\"Here everything is natural, precise, writes about \"Granduke\" famous Austrian-English historian and art theorist Ernst Gombrich, – and any slippage threatens to destroy harmony. In the picture there is no artificial, coercive methods like it came not by the will of the artist, and according to the commandment of nature\".Symbolism in \"Madonna of Granduca\"\nThe chiton and cloak of the virgin Mary in this painting by Raphael made in the traditional colors – red and blue (Rafael have not been to Venice, but, no doubt, knew that these colors were dressed Madonnas famous Venetian Giovanni Bellini). The red robe symbolizes the blood of the Saviour shed on the cross to atone for human sins; the blue of the mantles of the Madonna according to the language paints on her purity and innocence. But the solid dark background of the painting is not characteristic of Raphael, often preferring to portray his Madonnas surrounded by nature. The Mystery Of The \"Madonna Of Granduca\"\nPreserved preliminary drawing for \"the Madonna of Granduca\". In 2016, the year he, as well as the painting itself was presented to the Russian the exhibition \"Raphael. Poetry image\"in the Pushkin Museum. Important differences in the pattern from the picture are two: first, the Madonna of the figure inscribed in the Tondo, and secondly, behind it one can observe the generalized outlines of the landscape. But the Grand Duke Ferdinand III received the picture in the form in which she can be seen by us, – the Madonna on a dark olive, almost black background. Experts doubted whether this blank background belongs to Raphael? Conducted x-ray diffraction showed that a layer of dark paint hides much interesting. Not everyone was able thoroughly to consider, but it is clear that behind Maria once housed balustrade or high step, followed by landscape. On the right you can distinguish the overhanging structure – maybe it was a tree branch or curtain, as in The \"Sistine Madonna\". On the left, or the second half of the curtain, or wall of the building. However, everything is safely hidden under an impenetrable black background. The question is if Rafael, in obedience to one slave he reasons, toned background with dark colour, or it was done by someone later?Of course, we can assume that the artist is unsatisfied with their landscape and painted it. In the early Florentine period he was under the strong influence of the manner of Leonardo da Vinci, who preferred the dark and disturbing background for his paintings. But, even yielding to the temptation to repeat unusual for its clear manners leonardeschi the effect of the mysterious twilight, Rafael would retain some outlines of objects and hardly would have made the background impenetrable to the eye.And therefore more close to reality is the version that black background was written for Raphael by someone else. According to some, the owner of the painting in the XVII century was a famous Florentine painter of the Baroque era Carlo Dolci(1616-1686), from the heirs which the picture fell to Ferdinand III. Baroque is inseparable from the artistic reforms Caravaggioand his manners tenebrosocharacterized by the dark backdrops of the canvases with sharply protruding on the background shapes, moulded by contrasting chiaroscuro. It has become extremely fashionable, formed the whole direction conventionally called tenebrism. Perhaps, dramatically obscuring the background the \"Madonna of Granduca\", one of the owners of the picture (the same Dolci) decided that it will make the work topical? Or the then owner of the painting and did not know that the author of the painting is Raphael himself, and therefore provided it with a black background before selling to make it look like the work of a fashionable contemporary? All this is just speculation.Author: Anna Yesterday"},{"paintingTitle":"Portrait of a woman (Silent)","artistName":"Raphael","artistContentId":210477,"paintingContentId":"a97bec97-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1507, 64×48 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/orig/work/9d6/365041.jpg","paintingDescription":"\"Mute\" (in Italian La Muta) – provisional title, securing a female portrait by Raphael, created at the end of the Florentine period of the artist, before his final move to Rome.\"This painting is very dramatic fate,  the author of the biographical book about Raphael Alexander Makhov. – She did not see the light, he was hidden more than two centuries, it was in the Palace storerooms, leaning face to the wall, before being brought before the eyes of posterity. On no mention from Vasari, who couldn't see or hear, as if above the picture curse\".The painting is mentioned in the inventory of the legacy of cardinal Carlo de Medici in 1666, and in December 1773-th becomes the property of the Florentine Uffizi gallery, which will be until 1927 as the work of an unknown author (among the possible candidates called Andrea del Sartoand Piero della Francesca). However, once it was established the authorship of Raphael, which is now considered virtually certain, the city of Urbino, birthplace of the artist, demanded the painting back. The case was heard in court, which recognized the claims of the National gallery of the Marche (this Museum is placed in Urbino, in the Palace of the Dukes of Montefeltro, in the court which worked Giovanni rose and Raphael) is reasonable, and \"Mute\" returned to Urbino. There she became one of the Central pieces, but her misfortunes were not over. 15 Feb 1975 \"Dumb\" along with \"Madonna Of Senigallia\"and \"Flagellation Of Christ\" Piero della Francesca has been kidnapped, and March 23, 1976 all three pictures the police found in the Swiss Locarno, after which they returned to the gallery Brand. On the deep dark background is imaged in a three-quarter turn of the lady, whose features are grandeur and psychological subtlety. Her posture with crossed hands indicates the direct influence of Leonardo da Vinci, the art which Raphael and I met in Florence, and suggests that the artist was familiar with the female portraits of Dutchman Rogier van der Weyden (1, 2, 3). I believe that Rafael deliberately quoted \"The Mona Lisa\" (hands of the heroine) and \"Ginevra de 'Benci\" (expression) – like his paintings of Leonardo. \"Mute\" of Raphael also contains a psychological mystery, a certain reticence (in fact, a foothold for her name – this is an attempt to interpret her psychological state and light the look in his eyes, no real story behind it is not worth it), but in Raphael's painting there are no hard and deliberate mystery of Leonardo da Vinci.Rafael is much better than Leonardo and was considering the clothing of his heroine: her upper dress gamurra (typical women's clothing of the late XV - beginning of XVI century), decorated with braid and velvet ribbon, has a complicated cut and written volume, and in the image of clothing items of different colors Rafael achieves a delicate chromatic balance. The ratio of the deaf shades of green, red and brown is truly elegant, and their reticence is enlivened by protruding from the cuts at the shoulders fabric the embroidered linen shirt in ivory and white linen apron (at the time this piece of clothing was more decorative than functional). If the \"Mona Lisa\" is depicted as a very unadorned, for the heroine of Raphael her jewellery – three rings, Golden lace and a cross with enamels – are an indication of high social status. Scalloped rim ruby (symbol of prosperity) says that this ring is vintage, made in the Gothic tradition, and the rings on the index fingers (one of them with sapphire – a symbol of heavenly purity and chastity) reflect more modern tastes. There is no doubt that the model of Raphael belonged to one of the noble families of Florence or Urbino.X-ray and spectral analysis in the infrared allowed the researchers to see what is under the top layer of paint. Due to this it became known that for several years (from about 1505 to 1509) and the face and clothing of the heroine has changed significantly, it changed the interpretation of the image. So, initially the noble lady looked younger, she collected the final version of the hair was initially written by wavy and scattered on the shoulders and neckline of the dress was deeper. Over time, the image became stricter – for example, wide strip of fabric almost hidden from the eyes of the spectators neckline. Such transformations indicate changes in the social status of the heroine is likely that she was widowed. This version supports color dress (green was the color of widowhood and mourning) and what is in his left hand the character squeezes the handkerchief.In determining the possible prototype of the \"Dumb\" factor of widowhood was one of the key. Three main hypotheses. The first is that it could be Elisabetta Gonzaga, wife the Duke of Urbino, Guidobaldo da Montefeltro (however, it is still likely that her Raphael painted in another picture which in 2016 was also presented at the exhibition \"Raphael. The poetry of the image\" in the Pushkin Museum. A. S. Pushkin). More credible most of the researchers considers the hypothesis that \"Silent\" Rafael wrote not with wives, and sisters, Guidobaldo – Feltria, Giovanna della Rovere. She, daughter of federigo da Montefeltro, was destined to marry no less influential and strong-willed condottiere than her father, Giovanni della Rovere, and continue interrupted because of childlessness, Guidobaldo Urbino dynasty. After Guidobaldo the dominion of Urbino will go to his nephew, son of Giovanna, Francesco Maria della Rovere. Both families, the Montefeltro and della Rovere, was a patron of the young Raphael. The third hypothesis believes that \"Mute\" is not the Giovanna and her daughter Maria Varano, which at the time of writing, the picture could be about 25 years, but at this age she had become a widow. Maria Varano entered into an affair with a person of lower position, a page, than have incurred the wrath and indignation of the family. Some interpreters explain this understated sorrow, and \"psychological restraint\" \"Dumb\" and assume that Raphael in the portrait makes an allusion to an unwanted clan Rover illegitimate pregnancy of the heroine.Author: Anna Yesterday"},{"paintingTitle":"The Ecstasy Of Saint Cecilia","artistName":"Raphael","artistContentId":210477,"paintingContentId":"a97bec98-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1517, 220×136 cm • Oil, Canvas, Wood","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1200/work/a12/365656.jpg","paintingDescription":"\"The ecstasy of St. Cecilia\" written for the Bolognese Church of San Giovanni in Monte, is one of the most ambitious creations of Raphael. On the Russian exhibition \"Rafael. Poetry image\" in 2016, the picture has occupied a Central place.\"...this is the greatest painting of the High Renaissance– says the art critic Alexander timofeevsky on his Facebook page, – from the very first row, where Tondo Doni Michelangeloand Anna and Mary with the Christ child Leonardo. We say \"great style\", calling them anything, the Stalinist architecture of papier-mache, any fake crap, but the words still have meaning, and the \"Grand style\", grande maniere, this is just about the one number, from \"the Ecstasy of St. Cecilia\"!\"Archiv collected the minimum of knowledge required to understand one of the greatest works of Raphael.Who was Cecilia and why is it Holy?\nCecilia (sometimes found writing tutor or even Kilikia, dolmama) is revered not only by Catholics, but also Orthodox Martyr who lived in Rome at the beginning of the III century and is considered the inventor and patron of Church music. Cecilia was born into a family of wealthy Roman patricians and was brought up from childhood in the Christian faith. This meant a special approach to the good things of life: the young Roman sought to divide their property with the poor, a gorgeous dress, wore a hair shirt – a long shirt of coarse wool (it is on the picture of Raphael), which pricked and rubbed on the body and did not allow him to be pampered, but other than that, Cecilia gave the Lord a vow of chastity. Parents chose her a husband of noble pagan Valerian. In such situations, the virgin Christian acted differently. St. Liberata for example, managed to beg, so she grew up Besobrasova her beard and to discourage the groom from the thought of marriage and Saint Lucia of Syracuse the bridegroom where, after learning of her vow of celibacy, he decided to take her to a public house, praying so fervently that one thousand guards could not move her cart. But the Saint Cecilia, in contrast, saw the future husband is not pagan and not the torturer, and the man is the image and likeness of God. Cecilia convinced the groom not to break her vow and spoke so earnestly and sincerely that Valerian not only agreed with her, but together with his brother Tiburtius converted to Christianity. All three were led to Christ by another 400 people, was persecuted by the authorities, under the lash did not renounce Christ and was martyred.What is the music?\nCecilia lived during the III century, and is considered the patron Saint of music began much later – around the XV-XV centuries. In the thirteenth century saw the world famous collection of lives of saints, written by the monk-Dominican Jacob Vorgenskiy, later dubbed the \"Golden legend\". Containing many interesting details, he was an inexhaustible storehouse of subjects for painters. About Cecilia, for example, reported: \"led by the sounds of musical instruments in the house of his fiancé, Cecilia cried out to God, begging for her body and soul spotless\". In response to your prayers Cecilia ceased to hear the earth's cacophony and heard angelic singing. On her face Rafael captured the expression of delight and ecstatic abandon. Believe in the image of angels in the upper part of the painting Rafael encrypted Pythagorean music theory: their number and location, says Alexander Makhov, \"expresses the mathematical proportion of the most perfect musical consonances – octaves\". Cecilia, where this is not available to hear other people \"the music of the spheres\", therefore, becomes a Mediatrix between the celestial and earthly music. To this end, it, according to oral tradition, invented the body – the tool that can best reach people with the music of angels. It is no coincidence that this Holy inspired many composers: his \"Ode to St. Cecilia\" by Georg Friedrich Handel and Henry Purcell, Charles Gounod created a \"Solemn mass in honor of Saint Cecilia\". The enthusiastic description of Raphael's paintings left Franz Liszt.Broken tools - how they fit into the proverbial harmony of Raphael?\nIndeed, under the feet of Cecilia and her companions contemptuously abandoned musical instruments: a broken viola da Gamba, tambourine-tambourine, triangle, timpani and flute. About their realism Giorgio Vasari wrote with admiration that they \"you seem certain it is existing and not written\". However, most likely, the tools did not Raphael and his pupil Giovanni da Udine, as also told by Vasari: \"Rafael, are very fond of the talent of Giovanni, working over a wooden image of St. Cecilia... instructed Giovanni to write to the body that keeps Saint, they played with nature so perfectly that it seems a relief\". However, the organist and musicologist Alexander Maikapar believes that the viewer is looking at the Cecilia of Raphael has the right to wonder \"why organetto (or organino) – a small on-portable – St. Cecilia holds so that it is not only impossible to play, but it is even spilling some tube?\" The answer, apparently, is that any sounds that are extracted from the earth and material musical instruments, pales before the heavenly harmony. The one who hears Cecilia, angels singing, will not need it \"sinful songs of the earth\". Who of saints surrounds the Cecilia in the painting of Raphael? Why are they?\n\"The ecstasy of St. Cecilia\" is close to the iconographic type Sacra Conversazione ie \"Holy interview\". In paintings of this type of virgin and child is depicted surrounded by saints who could live in a completely different time and be patrons, customers, and the atmosphere of \"the interview\" is usually quiet contemplation. Something similar we see Rafael with the difference that in the centre of the composition is St. Cecilia. It is surrounded by the Apostle Paul, the Evangelist John, the great theologian St. Augustine and the biblical Mary Magdalene. Why should they? It is possible, according to Rafael they are best able to translate the idea of the superiority of divine to earthly and Christian philosophy of love. The Johann Wolfgang Goethe in his \"Italian journey\" wrote about them: \"Five saints next to each other, or to one of them we actually do not care, but their earthly existence is recreated so perfectly and there is no doubt that this picture wish of eternal life reconciling himself even the thought that you yourself turn to dust\".The saints depicted so skillfully that, according to Vasari, in their \"the figures we are seeing and the thrill of living flesh, and the manifestation of the spirit and the pulse of life in the most fleeting sense of\". The Apostle Paul written in red cloak and green tunic, he relies on the sword (perhaps because Christ spoke \"It is not peace I have come to bring, but a sword\", Matt.10:34), and in the hands of one of his Epistles. John traditionally depicts a young and beautiful, and at his feet is the eagle, a symbol of this Apostle. Augustine and Mary Magdalene also hold objects in their hands a staff and a container of incense. This allocation of items of Raphael as it balances the weight of the body of St. Cecilia. Its geometric forms and straight this tool could disrupt the smooth curvilinear rhythms of the painting, but Raphael finds a fine way to neutralize this effect, duplicating loosely lines the tubes of the body in the folds of the tunic of Mary Magdalene.Interestingly, of all five depicted the eye in the heavens pays only Saint Cecilia, the other four look in four different directions: Paul – down, John and Augustine – each other (i.e. right and left), and Magdalene is right for us. If you have in mind and the viewer looking at a picture, it turns out that Rafael has taken into account simultaneously three mutually perpendicular directions views. Another interesting detail: all the saints, but clad in sandals Cecilia depicted barefoot. It could mean that she is the only one quite detached from the earth, the other still firmly tied to the land on which we stand.Know anything about who was the customer of the picture?\nUnlike many other paintings – Yes. Ordered the picture of a noblewoman from Bologna named Helen, Dalola. She was prone to religious exaltation, after her death the Catholic Church declared the blessed Helen. Dalola assured that once in a dream before her hearing came a voice, which commanded her to build a chapel in honor of St. Cecilia at the Church of San Giovanni in Monte. Elena recounted the dream to his cousin, a Florentine singer and musician Antonio Pucci. He strongly supported the plans Helena: newly Pucci lost his voice and hoped the patroness of musicians Cecilia is committed to return it. Brother Antonio, the cardinal Lorenzo Pucci, fortunately, was well acquainted with Rafael, and promised to persuade the artist to undertake this work. Glory to Raphael by this time it was at the Zenith of his work was very expensive, but Elena Dalola brothers and Pucci were able to collect a large sum – a thousand Scudi in gold. Ordering seemed interesting artist and, despite strong employment, he went to work. \"The ecstasy of St. Cecilia\" multiply the glory of Raphael. Vasari recounts the legend that the artist Francesco Francia that Raphael was commissioned to meet the painting in Bologna and see how it will unload and set in the Church San Giovanni in Monte, in the form of paintings came in such a delight (and some believe this disorder is caused by the envy of more young and talented Rafael) that his heart stopped beating.Author: Anna Yesterday"},{"paintingTitle":"Doubles portrait of the spouses Doni (Portrait of Agnolo Doni. Portrait Of Maddalena Doni)","artistName":"Raphael","artistContentId":210477,"paintingContentId":"a97bec99-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1506 • Oil, Wood","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy800/work/887/369538.jpg","paintingDescription":"Moving to the first years of the XVI century from Urbino and Perugia, the artistic level of which he quickly outgrew, \"the capital Renaissance\" Florence, Raphael has achieved great success in the new portrait genre. One of the notable works was the double portrait of a married couple Donji wealthy wool merchant Agnoloand his young wife Maddalena who descended from a noble Florentine family Strozzi. These two pictures should be seen together, because they are conceived and executed as the paired images; paired portraits of Agnolo and Maddalena was kept by the descendants of Dhoni, paired with the mid 20-ies of the XIX century, immersed in the Florentine Palazzo Pitti, traveling, coming to exhibitions in other countries, too together – so, Agnolo and Maddalena together, came to the exhibition \"Rafael. Poetry image\" in the Pushkin Museum. Of A. S. Pushkin. It is believed that early communication between the portraits were not only semantic, but purely material – they are held together with hinges, like folding boxes of the altar. If you look at the cloud and the landscape in the upper right corner of the portrait of Agnolo and the upper left corner of a portrait of Maddalena, you can see their mutual transitions (though not completely accurate to millimeters, a coincidence). Portrait of the spouses Dhoni is such a family heirloom, a job could afford to order from Rafael, the man is very wealthy and not devoid of the claim that well-versed in the art.Words Giorgio Vasari confirm this thesis: \"While Raphael was in Florence, Agnolo Doni, which was equally stingy in all its other expenses, as he willingly, albeit with greater circumspection, spent, being a big fan of, on paintings and sculptures, ordered his own portrait and portrait of his wife in the same manner\".What do we know about the spouses of the Maddalena and Agnolo Doni?\nIt is known that Agnolo traded fabrics and was very rich, his business brought a good income. Clothes made from expensive fabrics (although its luxury is not flashy, she is reserved – the so-called \"expensive simplicity\") we can observe the portraits of Raphael, which, unlike Leonardo da Vinci, in his portraits attached great importance to the clothing. In detail writing down the details (buttons, patterns, the fine details of a cut), as well as jewelry, Rafael thus signified the high social status of their models. Rings spouses Dhoni is decorated with a ruby (symbol of prosperity), sapphire (sign of purity), emerald (refers to secret knowledge) and the impressive size of the pearl pendant on the chest Maddalena symbolizes virginity, she probably was a gift from Agnolo.Like many wealthy people, Agnolo Doni herself was a passionate collector of jewels (gems) and works of art, considering that is well versed in both. In honor of the impending marriage to Maddalena he had ordered work to appreciate later specialists is higher than even these rafaelia portraits: in 1504, the year of Michelangelo Buonarroti by order of Agnolo performed Tondo (the image in the form of a circle, from the ital. tondo - round) on the story of the Holy family, known in history as the \"Madonna Doni\" or \"Tondo Doni\" and was considered almost the only extant michelangelova easel works. You know, what's the deal with Michelangelo over conflict: Dhoni tried to understate significantly the cost of labor, and angry Michelangelo intended to leave the picture. The easiest way to attribute all this excessive stinginess Agnolo Doni, but writers have more original version. For example, the biographer of Raphael Alexander Makhov suggests that the Maddalena Doni angered and shocked in michelangelova ambitious and innovative Tondo, the Madonna is shown there is located between the tribes of Joseph, and with naked hands. What is the peculiarity of the portraits of Agnolo and Maddalena Doni Raphael's work?\nIn the couple portraits Dhoni, painted by Raphael, there's a little something from the manner of his teacher Perugino (for example, some showtest and stiffness of the lines), but much more – from portraits of Leonardo da Vinci that Raphael studied closely and productively. The position of the hands with crossed brushes reminds \"Mona Lisa\", as well as the desire of both the titans of the Renaissance to give a deep comprehension of the characters. But Rafael wholly exempt their portraits from the Leonardo's mystery and tension. He, however, committed to balance and clarity in everything – from the calm and bright images of the background landscape to a clear psychological interpretations of the personality of his characters.Here Agnolo – what can you say about him based on the portrait? Rafael captures the features of his appearance with great attention: finely curly brown hair to her shoulders, large, but the correct shape of your nose, \"thought lines\" of the nose, cleft chin, with the incipient stubble, a prominent Adam's Apple on the very graceful neck. Agnolo looks smart, strong-willed, untrusting and careful about the people like they say \"does not miss her\" – he seems to have caused the artist great sympathy.But the wife Agnolo Maddalena: her somewhat bulging eyes look cold and maybe even contemptuous, and lowered the corners of his mouth read arrogant condescension. It is clear that this is what this young woman used to give off the sense of his own noble birth. Burly shoulders, the roundness of the face, a strong neck Maddalena (and in contrast with this corporeal wealth – thin tree behind her shoulder) complete the impression of a majestic monumentality. This woman feels special very powerful, whatever ambiguity or hiding behind such an epithet. Portrait of the psychological characteristics of Raphael's completely transparent.Hands on the Doni portraits of spouses\nOne of the most speaking parts in the portraits of Agnolo and Maddalena Doni. Striking difference: in the hands of Raphael Agnolo detail depicted protruding bluish veins and minor irregularities of the skin, while the hands of his wife, written almost completely smooth and without individual characteristics: someone even noticed that the plump fingers Maddalena seemed to need something to Raphael, only to have something to put the family jewels.It is possible that both the artist conveys the difference in age between spouses: born in 1474, the year Agnolo was older than Maddalena for 15 years (she was born in 1489-m) and, by the way, at the time of their wedding in 1504, the year the bride was only 15. If this is so, then time can be cruel played on the Remo: now the skin on her face and neck richly sporocili cracks-cracks.Secret image on the back\nThe basis for the portraits of Agnolo and Maddalena Doni was painted on lime Board, and later analysis showed that the material is taken from the same tree. The flip side of both panels contains the figures in monochrome grisaille technique, which do not belong to Raphael. Their creation is credited to an unnamed artist known as the \"master of Serumido\" (his stay in Florence circa 1500-1530.). But that should mean those scenes? And why are they needed on the back of the portraits?The presence of grisela at rpm reinforces the idea that the Doni portraits of the spouses once was a diptych, which could be folded like a book, and then his \"cover\" spectator saw mythological scenes. The scenarios are most likely taken from the \"Metamorphoses\" the Roman poet Ovid. The scene on the back of a portrait of Agnolo shows how the gods inflict on the sinful human race the flood. On the back of a portrait of Maddalena we see the continuation of this story – \"the Revival of the human race\": after the flood the only survivors – the son of Prometheus, Deucalion and his wife pyrrha, – in obedience to the orders of the Oracle, throw on the ground the stones of which will soon be born a new humanity.The choice of subjects of a deep non-random is an allegorical spouses wish Dhoni to \"be fruitful and multiply\", however, were not expressed in the biblical material (which would be more predictable), and the images of the Greek myth about the great flood. In the first years of the marriage, in 1504-m, Maddalena and Agnolo Doni really felt the need for a successor, but their hopes and prayers, backed by such picturesque farewell, still crowned by the birth of his daughter in 1507, and in 1508 the son of-m respectively.Author: Anna Yesterday"},{"paintingTitle":"Cupid and the three graces.

After another six month apprenticeship with painter Jan Pieter Lastman, he opened his own studio. He began taking art students at his studio at the ripe old age of twenty-one years old. \r\n\r\nIn 1631, Rembrandt moved to Amsterdam, which at the time was rapidly expanding, and had great success painting personal portraits. In 1634 he married his wife, Saskia van Uylenberg, and in the same year began taking art students in Amsterdam. Although his public life was on track, his private life was deteriorating. His wife Saskia had their first child, a boy, in 1635, but he died at two months of age. Their second child, a girl, died at three weeks of age. Their third child, another girl, died before she was a month old. It was only their fourth child, Titus, who would live into adulthood. Saskia herself died after Titus’ birth, possibly from consumption. \r\n\r\nAlthough he lived an affluent lifestyle, Rembrandt lived far beyond his means. He had a large mortgage, and spent money on art, prints, and rarities, and avoided bankruptcy in 1656 only by selling many of his paintings and his collections of antiquities. Unfortunately, however, the sales price of his collection was disappointing, and he was forced to sell his house and printing press and move to a more modest location. Rembrandt outlived both his son Titus and his common-law wife Hendrickje, with whom he had a daughter Cornelia, and died in 1669. He was buried in an unmarked grave. \r\n\r\nDue to Rembrandt’s practice of having his students copy his own work, and many stylistic evolutions and style experiments done by the artist, as well as bad restorations of his works, the attribution of Rembrandt’s works is very difficult. Many art historians disagree as to whether or not many of his works are true Rembrants. There is so much conjecture that there may never be a consensus. There is also conjecture by art historians that Rembrandt may have had stereo blindness, causing only one of his eyes to work. This would have further benefited his painting style by flattening out his perception in order to paint it on the canvas.

Love the artist writes their best paintings, and one of them — \"Danae\", a famous painting by Rembrandt with a difficult history. The story from Greek mythology, tells about the love of Zeus for the beautiful daughter of king Acrisius, was popular among Rembrandt to modern artists. According to legend, the king received from the Oracle the prophecy that the cause of his death will be a grandson, and to avoid this fate, he ordered the closure of his daughter in an underground mansion, where he was denied access to outsiders. However, this did not save him: Zeus, enchanted Danae, turned into Golden rain and entered the cave. From this Union was born Perseus, subsequently sung by Homer in the Iliad. The painting is Rembrandt's \"Danae\" depicts the moment of the Olympic God in the secret bedchamber of a girl.To create this masterpiece, the artist used soft warm shades from Golden yellow to brown. In the foreground we can see a luxurious bed with reclining on him with Dan. The girl just woke up, awakened by the events, she looks in the direction whence comes the shining gold, covering outstretched her eyes from the blinding light. Because the canopy looks the old woman-servant, and at the head of the alcove you can see the image of Eros, whose face expresses suffering, but hands are tied — the symbol of \"forced chastity\".For him, Rembrandt's \"Danae\" was important: the picture was written not to order, but for themselves. In the middle of the last century with the help of x-rays art historians have found the evidence that the artist worked on the canvas. In the original version of the eyes of the women facing up, like the palm of his outstretched hand. In addition, in the first embodiment, the Rembrandt's \"Danae\" the woman's face was written with Saskia, but after her death the artist has slightly changed his features so that they reminded him of Saskia, and his new lover Gertie deeks.In 1656 the property of the artist was sold for debts. The location of the paintings was unknown before the eighteenth century, its owner was French collector Pierre Crozes. In 1772, at the request of Catherine II painting by Rembrandt, \"Danae\" was purchased from the heirs of the collector and placed in the Hermitage.In the summer of 1985 a resident of Lithuania bronys Magic splashed on a picture of sulfuric acid, which he brought with him to the Hermitage, then took out a knife and stabbed two of the cutting stroke on the canvas. In place of getting acid paint went bubbles and streaks, the upper layers of the soil has been damaged. Losses amounted to about 27%, hope for the restoration of the masterpiece was very small, but the result of hard work of restorers, which lasted 12 years, the canvas was able to recover as close as possible to the author's style. Today the painting is exhibited in the Hermitage under the protection of armored glass."},{"paintingTitle":"Portrait of a woman with a carnation","artistName":"Rembrandt","artistContentId":219933,"paintingContentId":"a9e3af11-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1660-th\n, 92.1×74.6 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1200/work/008/447404.jpg","paintingDescription":"There is still no description of this artwork.

It was called:– the most mysterious painting in the history is not clear, neither the vision of the author (although the order was clear, traditional genre and surprises were no signs), nor the presence of the hardly explainable \"extra\" characters and \"suspicious\" characters, and much more; the most paradoxical: Rembrandt had to write company Amsterdam the shooters, but instead of strict military discipline portrayed a truly unimaginable chaos; and the fact that for several centuries was perceived as the night, unexpectedly appeared by day;– the suffering of those paintings, which, despite the neglect during storage or deliberate vandalism, yet survived until our days: not only is the soot changed the original color \"Night watch\" and misled in relation to time of day, so the canvas was cut horizontally and vertically, suffered from displacement and inept restorations, and in 1990-m to year insane visitor of the Rijksmuseum splashed on the painting with acid. Agree, rarely a picture of the \"lucky\" to lose the original flavor, and a significant amount of the planned by the artist dimensions, and part of the paint layer. And for all that remain a masterpiece, an object of pilgrimage, feeding the literary and film industry in General, continue to prove their paradoxical reputation;– the most famous and biggest (379,5 cm x 453,5 cm!) Rembrandt – so \"Night watch\" is indicated on the website of the Rijksmuseum, which now is stored;most Baroque painting in history, the true apotheosis of the Baroque style in mood, energy, movement;as a result, the most contagious for the viewer, almost interactive: according to many of those who found themselves face to face with the characters of \"Night watch\" (a written and hung it so that there are no other options but to be face to face, and no) if you want to stay in front of the painting, then after some time it becomes difficult to overcome the desire to be a part of this noisy crowd, beat the drum, whistle, tap his feet, let loose with a booming laugh, waving pikes and in addition give a couple of stray shots up of the arquebus;and even the overrated – here opinions part of customers, and some critics agree: something clever and capricious Mr. van Rijn was clever.For the viewer, separated from the establishment of \"Night watch\" almost four centuries, confusion and questions continue to be layered: why do arrows need a giant group portrait? And what the city of Amsterdam – as many Amateur shooters? Why they are dressed, armed, and acting on the principle \"who in what is ready\"? Why elegant couple in the foreground are deliberately separated from the rest of the characters? Why in parallel with the Rembrandt of the Amsterdam rifle companies, wrote five more artists? Why do some characters in the movie demanded a refund for her money, because the General opinion about the work of Rembrandt was quite encouraging? Among shooters making a creepy girl in a Golden gown? Why is she the face of the artist's wife, and on her belt hangs a chicken and a bird's claw?.. Let us try, consistently seeking professional and Amateur (and is!) rembrandtian answers, to penetrate not only the atmosphere of Amsterdam in the middle of the XVI century, but in the creative cuisine of Rembrandt, where he matured and was shaped by such unpredictable things as \"Night watch\". We will, however, be prepared that many of the questions \"correct\" answer exists.Who are the hands-arquebusiers and why they are so valued in the Netherlands?\nImagine the Netherlands (\"low lying land\") the first half of the XVI century. More recently, they were bleeding under the rule of the Spanish Habsburgs, the stake of the Catholic Inquisition burned the Calvinist preachers, and Haarlem, Amsterdam and Leiden heroically resisted a Spanish siege, suffering unusual for these very rich and developed cities of the famine and even daring to go to extreme measures to open sea sluices and flood part of the territory, but to defend the independence. Southern provinces, Flanders and Brabant, willingly surrendered to the Spanish crown. But the Northern province was a \"tough nut\": seven of them came together and took for himself the name of the largest of them – the Netherlands (another name for the newborn state, the Republic of the United provinces). Spain could no longer dictate to the Dutch how to live their lives: with whom to trade, with whom to enter into political alliances and how to Express their religiosity. Of course, in the light of all the accomplished Netherlands the time of Rembrandt had experienced a few even euphoric rise of the national. Folk heroes of steel Dutch militia – men, who defended their cities. Rembrandt himself wrote in latnaya nechanice– they say he is, the son of the Leyden Miller, always ready to stand under the banner. The militia sang, about it legends. It seemed a miracle: the peaceful burghers, merchants, tanners, millers, druggists, greengrocers, clothiers at that horrible hour of the Motherland took up crossbows and halberds, had learned to shoot muskets and pistols arquebus (hence the name of arquebusiers) and cannonballs.Those who know the military brotherhood, do not want to lose the sense of community and when you come the quieter times. Dutch militia continued in peace time to gather together their companies, transformed into people's police. They could \"go out in patrols\" to keep order in the city. They continued to be registered units, companies such commanders have the illusion of, say, happen that the Dutch city will again be someone to protect. It is they – the heroes of Rembrandt's \"Night watch\".What rifle company of such a huge collective portrait?\nAnd this is just the consequence of the nationwide relationship to the arrows as national heroes. The Dutch like to wonder how to commemorate them, or rather our universal feat? And for this reason it was decided to construct a new building of the headquarters of the Guild of shooters with Grand rooms and elegant facade. The main hall of the Guild shooters with six tall Windows facing the Amstel river, was at that time the most spacious and presentable room in Amsterdam. There was the Queen – more suitable premises in the town was not. In the late 1630s – early 1640s high walls of the hall, it was decided to decorate a large-scale group portraits of the six rifle companies that they solemnly standing in the entourage of muskets, pikes, drums and flags, made a glory of unfading shooters.For the work were invited 6 artists. In addition to the Rembrandt, it was his disciples and followers Govert Flinckand Jacob Bakkerand Nicholas Elias Piceno, German Joachim von Sandrartand the best specialist of Amsterdam in this genre Bartholomeus van der Helstwas talking about that he learned the formula of the group portrait.In General, the Rembrandt was competing with anyone, and he certainly took the same van der Gelsta as a rival. The work was designed for a few years. The idea Rembrandt was extremely risky as all masters will be traditionally to build Riflemen in neat rows and prescribe in detail their costumes, regalia and flushed from the beer he planned to write something special, something no one had ever done before – a portrait of a company on the March. If the soldiers flocking from the streets in the high arched doorway and directed their commanders, rush somewhere on important matters – maybe just to protect the peace of the city, and can be again an advocate for the independence of the country. Rembrandt clearly wanted the result not just lined up in a row of arquebusiers, frozen along the horizontal axis (because they will represent all the others!), but a play, a sort of \"perpetual motion\", where all the time something happens: someone brandishing lances, someone charges the gun, somebody accidentally fired it up and the dog at his feet from fright went hysterical barking, someone understands, and asks the other where his place in this building, someone hits the drum, and captain banning cocq opens his mouth and raises his hand to give his men some orders.What is known of the characters of the first plan?\nA list of the soldiers of the company of Frans banning Coca remained at the back of the picture, and now anyone interested can set up a correspondence between their names and faces in the picture, fans of \"Night watch\" even be a special table (although you need to consider that Rembrandt to do \"Night watch\" dynamic, arbitrarily added and fictional characters).Rifle companies, usually headed by a captain and Lieutenant, and Rembrandt is no exception. The captain in a black suit with a bright red band name was Frans banning cocq. To the left of him is his assistant, Lieutenant Willem van Ruitenburg. About Banning coke known that he, although he was the only son of a wealthy chemist, managed to obtain a doctorate in law and managed to marry the daughter of one of the wealthiest and most influential politicians of Amsterdam, turning from a simple Burger to Patricia. Coca's wife gave him an aristocratic title, and he began to make a quick career in the city police he became first Lieutenant, captain soon, and the city Department had an important position – the chief Commissioner on the conclusion of marriage contracts.Lieutenant van Ruitenburg could also be a living testimony of the prospects of the Dutch democracy: his parents are greengrocers so rich that their son could afford to live in a luxurious Palazzo in the street along the Herengracht and so defiantly wearing expensive, dazzling look suit – tunic of yellow embossed leather, light hat and pantaloons, keleriskiu boots.Experts believe that Rembrandt very subtly conveys the features of the Dutch patrician hierarchy: although the Lieutenant and discharged in the dust compared to the simple black uniform of a captain, but he deliberately pictured below growth. And the shadow of the hand of the captain, falling on the suit of the Lieutenant directly in the groin, does not necessarily indicate their homosexual relationship (even a voiced version!), but it certainly indicates its higher social position and dominance.Their subordinates, privates and sergeants, mostly belonged to the Amsterdam Guild of clothiers. For this reason, and also because the militia had no uniform standard of shape, they are all dressed so differently. So how much Rembrandt received for his work?\nVery often you can find such a calculation: it is known that Rembrandt asked each of the shooters, which are depicted in the \"Night watch\", 100 guilders; in the company of banning Coca there were 16 of them, therefore, and the fee of the artist was 1600 guilders. But in fact, this simple arithmetic – just rooted legend. It could be confusing and complicated. First, there had to be an amount paid by a captain and Lieutenant – commanders, pictured in the foreground, traditionally took more. Secondly, some of those who refused somewhere \"on the margins\" or whose face was not too well (because of the Rembrandt experiments with light and with the location of the arrow) and could not refuse to contribute your portion of the fee for a lack of detail about his personality, appearance and military prowess on the canvas. Although documentary evidence of this is still not preserved, the second myth about the picture says: some arrows refused to pay Rembrandt. There is a third myth: greedy Rembrandt and even traded with the warriors and a varied cost depending on how profitable the position on the canvas occupied one or the other arquebusier. Thus, the exact amount received by the artist behind \"Night watch\", we don't know. One thing is certain: this picture, glorifying his name among the descendants, have rendered him a disservice in life. After \"Night watch\" profitable orders from Rembrandt diminished, because the world and at all times the vast majority of those who pay for a portrait, want to make it \"beautiful\" and \"it seems\", and not become the object of strangers and unpredictable artistic experiments.Why Rembrandt took the girl in gold?\nLow the girl with the red curls in a Golden dress at the right hand of captain Banninga Coca is the most enigmatic figure of the \"Night watch\". What is she doing among the arquebusiers? Perhaps it the canteen-Keeper – small peddler of those that were accompanied by soldiers in military campaigns, and the chicken (or rooster) on the belt – it product? No, inconclusive, because now peace, not war. Or is it something like \"daughter of the regiment\", its mascot (for this version, perhaps the majority, focusing on the gun belt girls)? Or she's a prostitute midget (in fact hanging on her belt rooster – a symbol of lust)? And such hypotheses, too, have a right to exist.But, it seems, we inevitably fall into a semantic dead end, if you're trying to find the presence of girls is strictly naturalistic explanation. Meanwhile, she's not the only one, albeit the most visible, is unreal a figure in the \"Night watch\". Two men in armor and helmets (one over the shoulder of the captain and the other Lieutenant) also have no relation to the real company of Banninga Coca, and not even Rembrandt portrays them. They are called emblematic figures. But again the question arises: what if the artist enters them?The two most obvious answers: first, to withdraw the composition from pre-programmed static, make it an element of confusion and dynamics, and secondly to inform the picture some additional meanings. The first really successful: new characters added to the picture nepredskazuemost and intrigue of the chaotic motion of these Simonazzi worked on the General idea is to transform a still canvas into forever live theater. The second is only added to the confusion, confused researchers, and blame – the unfortunate cock on the belt. In the Dutch language there is one marking arrow – Slovenia, derived from the word \"cloven\" – musket. It is consonant with the word denoting the bird's claw, and it is no coincidence emblems infantry units often became the proud birds of prey – hawks or falcons. But wait, what is it, Rembrandt suggests that the emblem best suited to the company of banning Coca, is just a dead rooster?! They say, what warriors is and logo? And, so, then Rembrandt does not glorify the Amsterdam shooters, and jeering at them? Pretends to admire, and all, and he secretly laughing? What low insidiousness! And most importantly – nothing will prove, can only produce a hypothesis...In 1642, the year when Rembrandt completed the Night watch, his wife Saskia, last year gave birth to their fourth child, died from tuberculosis. It was not summer, June 14. Saskia's body, dressed in a nightgown that was worn on her wedding night, another 5 days, until June 19, was at the home of Rembrandt. All this time he wrote his huge canvas. The girl in the Golden dress is a known face Saskia. Maybe she seemed a widower radiant angel, briefly illuminating the surrounding darkness like Saskia a few years have illuminated his life?Why \"Night watch\" was circumcised?\nIn the XVIII century the cult of Dutch shooters has waned: small guilds were abolished and their property transferred to the city magistrates, and Rembrandt's \"Night watch\" it was decided to move from Kloveniersdoelen (headquarters building) in the rebuilt city hall. The trouble is that there is such a high and spacious premises in the headquarters of the militia, was not found. To \"Night watch\" was able to fit on the wall, it is cut on four sides – the wide strip was cut from the top. Such barbarism only says that if a Rembrandt painting at the time and appreciated, it is certainly not perceived as a national treasure. Her cult began later.Fortunately, preserved reduced copy of \"Night watch\"captain banning cocq wanted to hang it at home and ordered a repetition of the painter Gerrit to Lundense. Due to this, you can imagine how the picture looked originally.In the town hall because of the peculiarities of the heating pattern is covered with soot and considerably darkened by the nineteenth century, many had forgotten that her name was once present names of the captain and the Lieutenant. The picture became known as simply \"Night watch\". This name stuck to the pattern so firmly behind her and when one of several restorations, clearing the black layer, found that the time of day depicted by Rembrandt – it is not a night and about two o'clock in the afternoon. It is, however, also very rough: under certificates of contemporaries of Rembrandt, many immediately complained that the picture turned out too dark. Contemporaries \"Night watch\" might seem unusual, odd, even compared to other paintings with small companies is shocking. But gradually there was an understanding that a Rembrandt is nothing more and nothing less than a national heirloom, something that gives pure Dutch reality universal meaning, makes the picture interesting to all mankind, not just the relatives and descendants of those gallant arquebusiers what it depicts.\"A group of brave guardsmen only is sent in daily, the city bypass, says British art critic Waldemar Januszczak, – but the feeling of importance, mood, motion, tension so baroquely intense, if they are going to save the world!\"Author: Anna Yesterday"},{"paintingTitle":"Bathsheba with letter of king David","artistName":"Rembrandt","artistContentId":219933,"paintingContentId":"a9e3af14-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1654, 142×142 cm • Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1000/work/19a/447644.jpg","paintingDescription":"There is still no description of this artwork.

Multiple debts ruined his paintings did not bring almost no income. Declaring bankruptcy, he sold all of the property and moved to Amsterdam. He lost his collection, consisting of beautiful art, without a faithful and loving wife Hendrickje, who died, being excommunicated from the Church for fornication with Rembrandt, became ill with tuberculosis his son Titus, and daughter-in-law died of despair. Patient semigone blind, abandoned by all, unable to hold the brush and therefore binds it with twine, the artist paints his final masterpiece. Rembrandt \"The return of the prodigal son\" was created shortly before the death of the painter in 1669. It depicts the final scenes from the gospel parable: the younger son departed from his father's house once, and returned, full of remorse. Falling on his knees in front of the old father, he buried his face in his knees, hoping for forgiveness. Head the burden of their heads shaved, clothes more like rags beggar, shoes trampled the whole appearance of the stranger said that he happened to see a lot and go through various tests.Father, carefully written out on the Rembrandt painting \"the prodigal son\", bowed his head over the miserable, like he was listening to his whisper. He leaned over her son, resting her hands on his shoulders; the old man's face expresses a feeling of sad joy and forgiveness. These two figures — the father and the son is like to become one, merged in a hug. Bright light falls upon them, and the figure of the eldest son, standing at a distance and with a slight sadness looking at this scene. For Rembrandt, these three characters had their importance: \"the Return of the prodigal son,\" he tells the story of his own life, full of passion, searching, suffering and hope. He repeatedly addressed this parable. In early sketches the artist had beaten the story, revealing the soul of the son, showing the amazement of the old father, due to the unexpected meeting. In the latest version of \"Return of the prodigal son\" Rembrandt's emphasis on the father figure, radiating love and forgiveness. Critics believe that the three main characters of the painting represent the artist in different years of his life.Depicted on the canvas, minor characters seemed to speak from the shadows. Next to big brother, we see a richly dressed man in a beret who sits, crossing her legs and watching with interest what is happening — presumably it's another brother. In the background one can see the barely distinguishable figures, which may be the servants of the Lord.In 1766 \"the Return of the prodigal son\" by Rembrandt acquired the Duke de Really Prince Golitsyn, carrying out the instructions of Catherine.

As a young boy, he worked in a porcelain factory. His drawing skills were early recognized, and he was soon employed to create designs on the fine china. He also painted decorations on fans before beginning art school . He moved to Paris in 1862 to study art, where he met Frederic Bazille, Claude Monet, and Alfred Sisley, all great impressionist painters. By 1864, he was exhibiting works at the Paris Salon, but his works went largely unnoticed for the next ten years, mostly in part to the disorder caused by the Franco-Prussian War. \r\n\r\nLater, during the Paris Commune on 1871, Renoir was painting on the banks of the Seine River, when he was approached by a number of members from the commune, who thought he was a spy. They threatened to throw in into the rive, but he was saved by the leader of the commune, Raoul Rigault, whom he had protected on an earlier occasion. He experienced his first artistic success in 1874, at the first Impressionist Exhibition, and later in London of the same year. In 1881, Renoir began his world travels, voyaging to Italy to see the works of the Renaissance masters, and later to Algeria, following in the footsteps of Eugene Delacroix. It was in Algeria where he encountered a serious bout with pneumonia, leaving him bed ridden for six weeks, and permanently damaging his respiratory system. \r\n\r\nIn the later years of his life, not even severe rheumatoid arthritis, which left him confined to a wheelchair and limited his movement, could deter Renoir from painting. His arthritis eventually got so bad as to leave a permanent physical deformity of his hands and shoulder, which required him to change his painting technique to adapt to his physical limitations. Before his death in 1919, Renoir traveled to the Louvre to see his paintings hanging in the museum alongside the masterpieces of the great masters. He was a prolific artist, created several thousands artworks in his lifetime, and include some of the most well-known paintings in the art world.

He met Aline Charigot, who would soon become his wife. In those years, Renoir went to Italy, got tired of the skills of Michelangelo and Bernini, reached Naples and experienced the most powerful artistic shock in his life – the frescoes of Pompeii in the local Neapolitan museum. Later, he called it the painting, which looked eternal, but did not harp on about it, the eternity of everyday life, noticed from around the corner of the next house. Afterwards, Renoir went to Algeria, and back to Paris, intoxicated by the bright white light of the East. And in this middle of his life, enamoured and filled with new artistic impressions, he declared that he had come to the end of Impressionism.It may seem strange, given that all the Renoir’s oeuvre is called Impressionism. What was it in the remaining 40 years? The Two Girls in Black was created just in this fracture period, at the end of Renoir’s personal Impressionism and at the beginning of the new period.After he has returned from Italy and Algeria, he did not change his models. The subjects of his paintings are the same women of Montmartre who posed for the Ball in the Moulin de la Galette, seamstresses and laundresses, young girls who never concerned about the ideals of virtue. They worked hard during the day and danced carelessly in the night. They gave birth to children out of wedlock and willingly posed for young artists to earn extra money.Renoir has changed neither the characters, nor motives, he has modified his painting technique. Keeping in mind the Pompeian frescoes, eternal and magnificent, he refused to use small, separate strokes, sharp sunlight glints on the skin, sketchiness. The foreground figures acquired clear outlines, as if Renoir brought them into focus, striving for greater clarity, smooth color transitions and splitting the deep versatile background into several saturated color spots.The black color is an intruder here. It should not be there. After all, the Impressionists abandoned the dark colors and deleted them from the palette. Even the shadows, thrown away by objects and trees on a sunny day, they learned to paint them with purple and yellow. And here it shamelessly occupies two thirds of the picture space: dresses, hats. But the Renoir’s black turns out to be not black. These are the shades of blue ultramarine, yellow and madder lake.The friend of the sitting girl runs up from the vivid red-hot space. Renoir did not like critics and art dealers to call his heroines meditating. “They are not meditating!” he laughed. She is thinking, watching, recalling something beautiful, waiting, dreaming, resting after a dance, but not meditating, by no means. Her friend breaks in from the outside, loud, dancing space, therefore she has motion blurred hat decorations and bow. In a moment, the sitting girl would turn back, and her hat would float in this general evening movement. A second to dance or laugh, to embraces or surprise. Renoir was wrong. It was not he to say goodbye to Impressionism, it was Impressionism to change and accommodate somewhat more.Author: Anna Sidelnikova"},{"paintingTitle":"Umbrellas","artistName":"Pierre-Auguste Renoir","artistContentId":216740,"paintingContentId":"aa49c3e1-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1886, 115×180 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1200/work/a83/158562.jpg","paintingDescription":"Once Auguste Renoir came to the workshop and his students inspired by the light-transparent palette of the artist and his colleagues, proudly announced: \"We threw tubes of black paint into the Seine!\" Renoir confused and began to tell the young rebels about the importance of black color in nature and in painting describing how many different shades it takes on depending on lighting.\"Umbrellas\" painting is a true Symphony in black, where the color sounds different in silk and velvet, deep basket, hat brims and on the tops of open umbrellas. Black leather gloves are not the same as black leather children's boots.In the 20th century, the scene was illuminated with x-rays to unravel the mystery. The mystery is at first glance quite invisible and can catch the eye of someone closely studying art and artistic techniques of the Impressionists in particular. But if you look closely and compare the manner of images of people in the right and the left parts of the picture, even those who are not savvy in terms of Renoir would have questions. The answer is that \"Umbrellas\" was painted in two sessions with a break for a very powerful and picturesque impression.In 1881, the artist began to work on the \"Umbrellas\" - this time he painted with airy and bright figures of the two girls and their mother to right side of the composition. This is a perfect and perfected over the last ten years completely impressionistic snippet: fuzzy outlines of the figures, expressive brushstrokes, shining hats and faces. Having not finished the painting, Renoir went to Italy. When Renoir was asked to tell about this journey, he replied: \"Paintings don't speak, you have to see them\". \"Will it help you, he said to his son Jean,  if I say that courtesans by Titian make you want to caress them?\". Anyway, Renoir admired Italy, he was struck by the people who looked to these gods of Olympus – all of these Italian fishermen and maids scrubbing pots. He was excited by the Renaissance artists, but quickly got tired, and the painting from Pompeii in the Museum of Naples has left a lasting impression on the artist. Renoir returned  to his \"Umbrellas\" five years later. Keen art critics argue that this can be judged by the outfits of the women to the right and left – those on the left, quite out of fashion to 1886. But the viewers who are not so carefully studied the fashion trends of the XIX century, seem more indicative of the contrast in the way of depicting the scene. The figure of a girl with a basket and men in the background, umbrellas, creating a stunning volume, is a sign of the changing style, which transformed impressionist style image. All his life Renoir had been experimenting and looking for artistic truth and, in spite of a steady dislike to all kinds of theories, experiencing these desperate crises associated with finding the right way of the image: plein air or studio, on a timeline or passing picturesque impression. \"Umbrellas\" became the most harmonious and talented embodiment of artistic crisis of Renoir and one of the first paintings, that took place in the museum next to the works by the recognized masters.Author: Anna Sidelnikova"},{"paintingTitle":"Dance in Bougival","artistName":"Pierre-Auguste Renoir","artistContentId":216740,"paintingContentId":"aa49c3e2-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1883, 181.9×98.1 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1200/work/d56/530641.jpg","paintingDescription":"1883 was a good year for Pierre Auguste Renoir: he received a fairly large order from a well-known collector and patron of the Impressionists Paul Durand-Ruel, who was there painting \"Dance in Bougival\". The customer wished to become the owner of three paintings, United by a common theme: the pair dance. Renoir enthusiastically set to work. A few years earlier he painted a picture depicting a variety of dancing in the open space pairs. This time the artist decided to reduce the number of dancers to only two people: all three canvases we see the same pair, however, the situation surrounding the dancers, different. On a single canvas couple dancing in the city, the second — in suburb, and the third in the village. Picture of Auguste Renoir's \"Dance at Bougival\" brings the viewer in a suburb of Paris, is very popular at the time among the Parisians and visitors of the city. Came here to sit with friends in cozy cafe, breathe in the fresh air under the trees, to make new friends. Bougival with its incredibly beautiful scenery has attracted many painters, including the Impressionists.\r\nDescription of paintings by Auguste Renoir \"Dance at Bougival\"\r\nThe canvas depicts a couple dancing: a young girl and a middle-aged man. Girl outfit emphasizes her beauty: trendy close-fitting dress of a soft pink color blends wonderfully with white skin and a light blush on his cheeks. Numerous ruffles skirt, cascading waterfall and lush, shot in motion — from beneath them barely visible delicate slipper. On the head of a dancing girl wearing a stylish red hat which is decorated with a bouquet of flowers with dark purple buds. Partner girls dressed in contrasting dark suit and dandy boots, matching with a straw hat. The headdress covers from the audience of the dancer's face: we only see the beard and mustache. If a woman, who posed for Renoir, the art there is no doubt that it was Suzana Valadon, underlying the man's face gave rise to two versions. One of them is the painting of Auguste Renoir's \"Dance at Bougival\" depicts I. A. Fournaise, on the other — each artist P. Lot.The position of the head men, we can assume that what he is whispering to his partner. The girl slightly turned from the gentleman, her gaze aimed to the side and down, and it seems as if she's embarrassed, but her arm is around the man's neck, suggests otherwise. It is likely that she was looking for a boutonniere, which broke during a quick turn and fell to the ground, and the partner comforts her, promising to buy another.Picture of Auguste Renoir's \"Dance at Bougival\" is different from the other two paintings great ease, lightness. A dancing couple is depicted on the background of the people sitting at the tables open a summer café, but the story is almost never lingers on them. The faces of secondary characters fuzzy, bright green leaves on the branches of trees blurred — this technique allowed the artist to realistically convey the sense of movement of a dancing couple. The whole scene is bathed in bright sunlight that creates an atmosphere of celebration. This blade has a reduced author's copy of that Renoir created specifically for Susanne Valadon. It is virtually identical to the original, but drawing this option, the artist painstakingly wrote out the face of the young dancers — so that there remains no doubt: the painting depicts Susanna. Today, this copy holds a private collector from the United States.The original \"Dance at Bougival\" from the collection of Paul Durand-Ruel, the customer of Pierre-Auguste Renoir, was in the Boston Museum of fine arts: painting was purchased by the Museum in 1937 for 150 thousand dollars. Two other paintings from this series are now in Paris at the Musee d'orsay."},{"paintingTitle":"Still life with bouquet","artistName":"Pierre-Auguste Renoir","artistContentId":216740,"paintingContentId":"aa49c3e3-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1871, 73.7×59.8 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1200/work/7e2/318885.jpg","paintingDescription":"\"If I sold only good pictures, I'd starve to death\" joked Renoir.

But this still life special. It's still life-initiation, still life-recognition. Edouard Manet.First reminiscence: engraving. In the background renourish of still life, engraving to the painting, which now little who knows. In the XIX century it was considered a work Velasquez and she was in the Louvre together with other Spanish masterpieces trapped in a Museum halls as Napoleonic war booty. Manet was in awe of Spain and Velazquez, he painted dozens of paintings inspired by Spanish motifs Spanish costumes, composition, and motives of Spanish artists. Now the canvas is attributed to son-in-law of Velasquez Juan Batista martínez del Maso or just the Madrid school. But the engraving that was inside \"Still life with bouquet and fan\" definitely did Edouard Manet.Reminiscence two: flowers. If it were not for the engravings, and all other roll-call could be considered a slightly far-fetched, but Renoir himself legitimized further exploration of allusions. The flowers on the controversial painting by Edouard Manet Olympia too large, critics did not fail to reproach the artist in the proportions that are off. But it is impossible not to notice: it is the semantic center of the picture, which turns an ordinary image of a naked female nature at the very unambiguous story: the bouquet somewhere in the living room, on the threshold of the door, the man who's about to have to take Olympia Nude Olympia. This bouquet certainly remembers everything: criticism, bristling with poisonous accusations of impropriety, and the young Impressionists, Manet who called his teacher. Bouquet still life Renoir was collected according to your taste, but wrapped it exactly the same as \"Olympia\", a dense white paper.Reminiscence third fan and books. Japan became for the French, no less a revelation and artistic turmoil than Spain. Composition, color findings, drawing Japanese prints – all of it literally sprouted in impressionism. Monet, van Gogh, Cezanne and of course Renoir bought stacks of Oriental landscapes in art shops, hung them on the walls, absorbed and studied. \"I'm sure the Japanese landscapes better than others. Only one thing: the Japanese artists managed to find the hidden treasure\"- admired Renoir many years later. This Japanese-fan explanation could be, if not for the books and if not already specified the need to look for a Manet. In every detail. And mana is back. Two years before Renoir undertook to collect all these iconic things on the same painting, Manet writes portrait of Emile Zola behind a Desk.

The Parisian beau monde admired her and sought to get to all the premieres with Jeanne appearing on the stage. She was a real celebrity of her time, and her portrait was something like a central photo shoot in a glossy zine. Which photographer would refuse to shoot, for example, Jennifer Lawrence or Scarlett Johansson for Maxim or GQ?Auguste Renoir also did not refuse the offer of the girl’s parents to paint a portrait of Jeanne Samary. She was really charming with her ringing laugh and shiny skin. To understand his new model and create not just an external portrait, but a portrait of her inner world, the artist even heroically attended the performances of Comédie-Française. After many years, Renoir recalled that he apparently really wanted to see her, while the whole place bore the stamp of boredom for him. Fortunately, she often played in Musset’s plays. No one ever confirmed the uncertain guesses about the romantic relationship between Auguste and Jeanne, but, according to the memories of his friends, the 20-year-old actress was clearly fascinated with Renoir. He, most likely, was carried away by her feminine, touching, cheerful image, full of strength and joy. It was extremely important for Renoir to paint Jeanne in the space where she lived. Every day he resorted to her home and immediately grabbed the brush, sometimes even forgetting to say hello.This new fascination gave the artist confidence of his vocation and gave hope for the future. It was a time when the Impressionists were mercilessly criticized, a time when they lost the trust of traders and often starved when two failed exhibitions cracked their faith in their own strength. For example, it was the time, when one of the traders came to Renoir and proposed to forge pictures by Theodore Rousseau.To all the virtues and charms of Jeanne we should add her sharp intuition, which made her unerringly choose the man who can glorify her. She would have been forgotten long ago, but for Renoir. Now no one would care that Jeanne Samary later married a rich man Paul Lagarde. He loved the young actress so much that he decided to marry against the will of his parents. Jeanne had three daughters, and the actress herself became a wonderful mother and even wrote a children's book.And while Jeanne was still a star and the whole Paris was talking about her, critics carried her portrait to the dust. They talked about the flashy bright clothes in the paintings by Renoir, about the defiantly saturated pink background. Sometimes it may seem that women never wore bright clothes before Renoir. He not only allowed women to flaunt in emerald green dresses in his paintings, but he changed the viewer’s attitude to the perception of color, joy and celebration forever.Author: Anna Sidelnikova"},{"paintingTitle":"Ball at the Moulin de La Galette","artistName":"Pierre-Auguste Renoir","artistContentId":216740,"paintingContentId":"aa49c3e5-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1876, 175×131 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy800/work/4e0/271861.jpg","paintingDescription":"One day in early summer Renoir made a sketch of the ball in the pub \"Moulin de La Galette\" in Montmartre. This idea gave him no rest: to have a big plein air in the forest, among the motionless trees and the river, and in the midst of a crowded celebration. To do this, the artist settled in Montmartre for the summer quickly became a local celebrity, although the place was not the most calm and trustworthy. The kids are often born without marriage, and while mother worked and my grandmother looked after the farm, the kids were left to themselves, went unwashed and hungry. Renoir was daily distributed to them the biscuits, milk and handkerchiefs and genuinely worried about abandoned babies: what if a fire starts or the cat will fit in the cradle? He did not think of the morality of the girls neighbors, and the habit of admiring their beauty, sparkling eyes and youthful skin, gathered in a sloppy bun with hair and sincere smile. A project for shy Renoir looked desperate to find a dozen sitters to be on a huge canvas right next to the dancing couples and to repeat this trick daily. But surprisingly easy developed for male characters agreed to pose for fellow artists, and to attract the local girls Lenoir invented his own method. He was acquainted with the mother of the young beauty asked permission to write to the daughter and offered a fee for this work. Over the fact that Montmartre mother came to him themselves and asked to write their daughters Nudes was rife.Every day throughout the summer of 1876 someone from the friends helped the artist to make a huge canvas to dance floor \"Moulin de La Galette\" and the work begins. The fantastic effect of sunlight filtering through the leaves of the acacia trees that Renoir was able to pass on the moving figures, criticism is not appreciated. At the third impressionist exhibition, where the picture first appeared before the audience, it simply did not pay attention. Madame Renoir, the artist's mother said to him one day that it will take 50 years before people will begin to understand his painting. Actually it's 20, while from the personal collection Gustave Caillebotte the painting was moved to the Museum of the Luxembourg gardens, and 53 until it was moved finally to the Louvre.

Sometimes Renoir anyone to write in the open air, but really amazing scenery he did, when they were attended by people.\"Paddling\" (\"La Grenier\") was the name of a school near Paris, which became popular thanks to the railroad to get here was made possible for some 20 minutes. The restaurant was located on a pontoon, moored to the banks of the Seine, but the name he was not for a special affinity for river inhabitants. Frogs were then called free in his Hobbies of ladies, which rapidly changed lovers and not recognized by society imposed moral framework. Lovers have come here to retire in the shade of the trees, alone – to find a few, but all, without exception, to heartily to dance and have fun. Female frogs Parisians said with a smile or with contempt, whispering about their gaudily bright costumes and loud laughter. Renoir never tried to give moral values – he looked at the pretty girl and saw just a pretty girl. \"Of course, sometimes can be seen in \"La Grenier\" as two women kissing on the lips, but they looked so unspoiled!\" he said even many years later.Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Claude Monet came in a Paddling pool together, put the easels close, and wrote the same scene. Both often had no penny in my pocket and not a single crumb in my stomach, but they are passionately caught the glare on the water, the sunlight coming through the leaves and playing on the figures and faces of people on the grass and the water. To these two because no one wrote – no wonder, breathing the same air, the artists wrote very similar, with a hungry passion while invisible made revolution in art. Now a rare lover of painting, with no artistic education or special training to distinguish \"Splash\" By Monet from the \"Frog\" of Renoir. Daddy Furnas, the owner of the restaurant, money for lunch with these weirdos never took – sometimes only asked him to pay the sketches of landscapes that Renoir and Monet considered failed. He laughed when artists claimed that they have no special value and no one wants to buy them: \"What do I care if they are beautiful and cover stains on the walls\".Degas was of course a sarcastic grumpy, but returning from a difficult gear, exhausted and tired from another trip in search of a beautiful landscape, Renoir would have agreed with him. \"Plein air is not an art but a sport\"- joked the artist.

Renoir loved it: don't bear in mind anything of the such, no plot, no intrigue or history, no deep philosophical subtexts and historical contexts. Renoir would be very unhappy if I heard that in connection with this mention of the war. It's only two words. The war ended 10 years before writing this piece, France forever said goodbye to the monarchy and a few years remained in desperate poverty, disease updates, and struggled with deep depression, re-learned to celebrate. By this time there were 6 exhibitions of the Impressionists.By 1881 Paris flooded with a wave of creative excitement and optimism, life becomes easy and real. Cafes, concerts, cabaret, Studio, fashionable yachts-clubs, theaters, restaurants, salons fashion dresses, circuses – finally. At the same time, reduced working week, belosic, factory workers, porters, market vendors, butchers, barbers getting more free time – they often dance and sing. Until now, the only activities for the poor had a ball, and rich – horse riding, and suddenly the most fashionable and fun entertainment is sailing, all the polls are learning to paddle and hold competitions.Restaurant Fournaise family was everything, the hotel, the yacht club and loved in the suburbs of Paris, a meeting place for young artists and writers. Renoir lived in the summer in the town of Chatou and invited friends to dine with him the day off to pose for a new picture. Alin, Sarigo, the future wife of the artist, plays with the dog, Gustave Caillebottestraw hat on chair smokes Jeanne Samaristraightens her bonnet and talks with the art critic Charles Ephrussi. Alphonsine Fournaise, the daughter of the owner, leans on the patio railing, and the Monsieur Fournaise, a muscular bearded man in a straw hat, which peers into the distance. They were all in Chatou at different times and all patiently posed for Renoir in the desired position. Today, the restaurant \"Maison Fournaise\" looks exactly the same as in the days of the artist, and the terrace, where rest the heroes of his \"Breakfast\" is called \"Renoir\". The restaurant's terrace in his honor.

Although he was raised as a Catholic and painted Counter-Reformation pieces f or the church, he was born into a Protestant family. In 1568, his mother and father fled the Spanish Netherlands due to persecution of Protestants. Jan Rubens, Peter Paul’s father, began a sordid affair with the woman to whom he was court advisor, Anna of Saxony. His father was imprisoned for the affair and two years after his death, Peter and his family returned to Antwerp, in the Netherlands, and beginning at the age of twelve was raised as a Catholic. He began his artistic apprenticeship at age fourteen and completed his education in 1598, when he became an independent master painter.  \r\n\r\nDuring his career, Rubens traveled to Italy and Spain, and was influenced by the great works of Titian, Veronese, and Tintoretto, as well as Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, and Michelangelo. He returned to Antwerp upon his mother’s death in 1608, and remained there as a court painter for the Archduke of Austria, and received special privileges as both a painter and a court diplomat. In 1610, Rubens moved into the house that would become his studio, where he taught students and created most of his paintings. This house has now become the Rubenshius Museum. His most famous students, friends and collaborators were Frans Snyders, Anthony van Dyck, and Jan Brueghel the Elder. \r\n\r\nThroughout his life, he was relied upon not only as a master painter, but one whose diplomat talents were required by many a court. Between 1627 and 1630, he traveled between England and Spain, in attempts to create a truce between the two nations. He was knighted by both the Spanish monarch, Philip V, and the English King, Charles I. Cambridge University also awarded him an honorary Master’s Degree. \r\n\r\nFour years after the death of his first wife, Rubens, who was 53 years old at the time, was married to a 16 year old named Helene Fourment, whom he used as model in many of his later paintings. His fondness for the full figured woman has since spurned the term “Rubenesque,” which is still used in Dutch to refer to such women.

Painting to enlighten the x-rays and saw a completely different background, which was later rewritten by the artist himself. But the picture is worthy of a separate exhibition, even if inquisitive scientists found that there are no secrets except the obvious – is the work of a passionate lover and admiring admiringly of the artist.Elena Forman was 16 when she married 53-year-old Rubens, diplomat, nobleman Spanish and Flemish at the same time, the most famous artist of the country. She was the daughter of a merchant of carpets and tapestries, but her family had 10 children, it did not give a large dowry, but she was young and beautiful. The goddesses, the graces and the nymphs of Rubens, until now only predicted by an image of Elena, giving all these mythical women have not yet met features. Now this image got the living embodiment of the gentle, virtuous, shining. Elena appears in the life of Rubens at the time when he has already learned how to write women. In his Nudes there is no vulgarity and calling, the women Shine a light thin skin, through which glow bluish veins. Looking at one of his naked beauties, admiring Guido Reni once said that, must be the Flemish mixes real blood in their ink so imaged body full of life.Rubens was bad, he was in a hurry to get married that sent the Archduchess Isabella's request to hold a wedding ceremony in the Catholic post. Peter Paul will write to a friend: \"I took a young wife, the daughter of honest citizens, though me from all sides tried to convince to make a choice at the court; but I was afraid normal for the nobility of bad traits – pride, especially strong female. I wanted to have a wife who would not blush, seeing that I take a brush\". He's not just refusing to seek his fortune at court, he left forever using his inexplicable ability to remain a pet of kings, and making them their own conditions of life and work. He leaves the diplomatic service, settled in a country castle, a young wife loaded with presents of jewels and finery, and endlessly writing her portraits.\"Coat\" - the intimate and playful, Rubens wrote it for fun and bequeathed after his death to Elena. First, he writes half-length portrait in which he is swapping the bow to the side Titian's \"Girl in a fur Cape\". Then he adds to the main Board one more – and delivers myself happy to write Elena at full height. Elena Forman was recognized beauty, and Rubens too educated and wise husband to lock up his young wife within the walls of a country house. He writes her generous and insistent in the image of Venus painting \"The Judgment Of Paris\"in the way of Beersheba and one of the \"The three graces\". He is without doubt arguing with the customer, among other things, the king of Spain, when the latter suddenly seem too provocative nudity of goddesses in the \"judgment of Paris\". Rubens is confident is the best that is in his picture.

He worked like a man possessed over the fact that I ordered more. In the period of deafening glory and an inexhaustible flow of large-scale orders, the landscape was interested in Rubens only as sets for popular mythological and religious subjects. He quietly gave this part of the work to pupils, leaving the basic sketches of characters and the final touches to the painting. At the same time for gambling and collector of Rubens landscape was a personal passion in his personal collection of works of this genre was much more than genre paintings.In the last 10 years of his life Peter Paul allows himself to be happy, loving, independent, peaceful and sentimental. At the same time the landscape of the minor and auxiliary of the genre becomes an important and independent. The artist meditates on his own happiness, devoting himself to the painting which gives him pleasure.During these years, Rubens buys a country house between Brussels and Antwerp, the Steen, often went there for a long time and lives with his family. Diplomatic mission, travel across Europe in pursuit of masterpieces and antique cameos, working four-year journey from Antwerp to Paris Antwerp, Spain, Italy – all long gone. Peter Paul more in a hurry. The artist of 58 and he is at home. Workshop in the castle are much more modest Antwerp his \"art factory\", it is difficult to hold a brush because of illness, but only now he discovered nature as an independent model, and only now he writes her with an inspiration.It absolutely does not mean that he went out into the fields and painted from nature – he has little interest in Botanical accuracy or atmospheric paintings. The nature of Rubens has no relation to the real Flemish landscape, it always works, subordinates first of all a picturesque, purpose, and feeling. It's not the sky over the castle Wall and the sky in General, all those thousands of sunrises, sunsets, shades of the midday heat, which the artist had to admire in my entire life in different parts of Europe. Rubens not worried about the momentary state of nature – his landscapes are harvested in the space of all miracles and phenomena occurring on the earth at different times: rainbow, storm, and light winds. His landscapes are timeless and at any time.\"Landscape with rainbow\" Rubens writes in continuation of other work – \"The view of the castle Walls early in the morning\". If it were possible to take from the collection of Wallace one picture and from the National gallery of London, the second was to connect two of these species, it would be a large-scale panorama in the spirit of modern photo tricks. Peter Paul as if it could not stop: it begins with three small boards, shot down between himself and continually adding to them the continuation. So it turns out that \"the View of the castle Walls\" composed of 17 hardwood slats that were added to the original miniature. And then the second part, \"Landscape with rainbow\", is almost the same size. The world of Rubens no longer fits within a single Board.Catalogue of paintings by Flemish still not described in detail, there are 3 thousands of paintings, but only about two dozen landscapes. In this case John Constable argued that these two works best, wrote to Rubens in all his life.Author: Anna Sidelnikova"},{"paintingTitle":"The Lion Hunt","artistName":"Peter Paul Rubens","artistContentId":216353,"paintingContentId":"aabaae23-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1615, 73.6×105.4 cm • Oil, Wood","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy800/work/3e2/570682.jpg","paintingDescription":"There is still no description of this artwork.

Maria was delighted from preliminary sketches, gathered them in a voluminous book and appreciated no less than the finished canvases. Work on the cycle lasted four years, Peter Paul traveled from Antwerp to Paris, claimed the sketches, returning home, doing a few scenes, was taking them to Paris and immediately had a few of the following ideas. He had to endure three hellish circle of censorship: present drawings to the Queen in the company of the adviser for art, her son, Louis XIII, and finally, cardinal Richelieu.This tight control was necessary not only because the monarchs were worried about diplomacy Rubens: heavy chin, colorless eyes, and a catastrophic lack of feminine charm in the Queen cared about the censors only in the last turn. Marie de Medici, scheming with the savory character, has just returned from exile, where she sent her own son, Louis, and could not boast of a truly heroic and glorious episodes of his biography, without admixture of conspiracies, murder and meanness. Peter Paul had to bring all the gods of Olympus to provide some doubtful stories of monumental and historical value. And if Flanders he returned after execution of the French order of national hero, received a knighthood, rent and other honors, from the descendants of him once again severely battered. For example, a naked mercury with an olive branch, which is in the picture \"Angouleme world\" shamelessly lands directly between two cardinals.The story with the death of Henry IV and Regency of Mary so densely populated with gods and allegorical beings, that is suspicious. It's not the most perfect episode in the history of France. Marriage of Maria de Medici and Henry was extremely diplomatic move, and the king did not even think to abandon numerous mistresses after his marriage. So his death was not the Queen very upset. She gladly accepted the Regency on the same day.Much more strong impression supposed to produce, without a doubt, the viewer has a huge canvas, 20 sqm, full of despair and hope at the same time. In the left part of the picture is a terrible and solemn – the deceased, but gained their immortality among the gods, Henry IV ascends to heaven, accompanied by Saturn and Jupiter. Of the deceased king, whom the French called \"good king Henry\", is mourned by two goddesses. Lick the goddess of war Bellona in Golden robes admired Paul cézanne so much that he requested 10 times at the Louvre permission to copy it. Many Rubenesque coloristic and graphical findings became the inspiration and a tutorial for artists in the nineteenth century.The right part of the picture – plural, passionate, allegorical scene of the making of the Regency, in which critics find composite quotation from \"Madonna Of The Rosary\" Caravaggio. By the way, the only candidate among French artists, which Marie de Medici was considered in the process of finding the artist for this cycle were Simon Vouet. But just the enormous impact of naturalism Caravaggio the Frenchman frightened her too close and unbiased look might be for the Queen unflattering. Rubens surrounded Mary with allegorical figures, which, without violating the historical truth, increase the importance of events momentous: personalized France presents Mary ball, a symbol of power, directly under the arches of the arc de Triomphe, the goddess of wisdom at the throne of Mary is already starting to give her important advice, and the goddess of fate gives a rudder, as the symbol assigned to the Regent.Such a sweet Rubens would be sick, but the artist is not so simple. Only in the XIX century, gold dust, enveloping ascended to heaven Rubens, crumbled and dissipated. And calepodius, at first glance, the works of Fleming began to notice a revolutionary, even a hooligan audacity. Take, for always stocking rumpled and unkempt Shoe Henry on all canvases of the cycle, moreover, where the king is wearing sandals. Or the dog that appears in two pictures \"The Birth Of Louis\"and \"An arranged marriage\". This dog Rubens personally brought Mary a gift from the Archduchess Isabella – a kind of wink in the direction of his Flemish Queen.Author: Anna Sidelnikova"},{"paintingTitle":"Massacre of the innocents","artistName":"Peter Paul Rubens","artistContentId":216353,"paintingContentId":"aabaae27-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1611, 142×182 cm • Oil, Wood","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy800/work/272/313284.jpeg","paintingDescription":"Rubens spent the years 1600-1608 years in Italy and Spain, where he immersed himself in the world of classical art and the art of Renaissance After his return to Antwerp, inspired by the works of the old Masters,he paints a series of paintings on religious and mythological themes.

Their main virtue that led rather dubious characters in history – real brotherly love and dedication. Here at Rubens, they have no idea about those tests in which they will have each other to support and pull from the other world, while they think only about one thing – revenge. Castor and Pollux steal the brides of their cousins right from the wedding, not because girls like them, and because she quarreled with the brothers. It's then the twins will have to answer for their meanness: the one dies, the second immortal, will share his immortality with his brother - and both half-immortal, will live on mount Olympus, in Hades, through the day.Rubens – Baroque painter, he brotherly love is not interesting because it won't build a passionate, swirling in a circle of rapid composition, it an interesting battle and confrontation. Also, it will build its scenes of hunting and battle exotic animals, all those tigers and lions, which will be admired by the romantics (1, 2, 3). After 200 years Eugene Delacroix go on a journey through Belgium, England and Germany to see how much of Rubens. And spin emanating from the hands of the Pollux, we meet the Phoebes will be his favorite female body he will repeat the same inhuman turn tender body \"Death Of Sardanapalus\". One of the slaves of the king would escape from the hands of the servants the same violent gesture and with the same desperate terror.Rubens wrote quickly and widely, chose a huge canvas – just as the monumentality of his figures (the wise, noble old people, powerful muscular men, with tanned skin, rounded, floating women) received the desired scale. Allegorical, mythical creatures, heroes of old legends, historical characters, the ubiquitous putti – \"the language of the ancient so deeply in his system of artistic thinking that he could \"talk\" to him without the slightest Flemish accent\".

It has been more than 400 years, adorns the Central Cathedral of Antwerp, for which it was written. Around it being completely different debate and believed it even Rubens in God?Art historian Alfred Michiels (Alfred Michiels) in the nineteenth century was literally terrified of its own discoveries: \"The scene of the descent from the cross is imbued with anti-Christian sentiments, and never far from religion the work has not adorned the walls of the Church... the Body of Christ does not resemble the body of a God, who should rise on the third day. Is the mortal remains of a man, which forever extinguished the flame of life. The sight of him did not leave the slightest hope. This body, already touched by the first signs of decomposition. Look at those faded blue eyelids, this rolled eyeball! Look at how lifeless his flesh! It's a real corpse... Nothing says here, that before us — God. Even relatives and disciples do not believe in the Divinity of its origin. They are absorbed one thing: to remove the mortal remains from the guns of shameful execution and transfer them to a safe place. In no other work of art didn't manifest such audacity skepticism, but rather unbelief!\"With such distrust of the modern art lovers in doubt, loved it even Rubens women, depicting their bodies such loose with all these infinite folds and dimples. It's hard to believe after centuries of drying the female ideal of beauty to the current limit, but not only Rubens himself, but the Flemings generally admired the beauty of these delicate, languid, lush, light-skinned telephone And Elena Forman, his wife and favorite model of Fleming, considered one of the most beautiful women of Antwerp (1, 2, 3).In religious painting, as in many voluptuous Nude Rubens spoke to his contemporaries in a language that is understandable to this very minute, and the timeless and eternal at the same time. The Catholic Church in the era of the Counter-reformation laid upon artists a lot of hope – that they had to reach the hearts and minds with his genius, that they had to restore the authority of the Roman Catholic Church and to suppress the many Church reforms that had broken out and spread through Europe like wildfires in the midst of summer. And Rubens has chosen the right tone and the right images – not because they served the Church, but because they sincerely believed in what he was talking about. Peter Paul, a true Catholic, began the day with mass, Peter Paul, a true artist, twisted to the limit of emotional, intimate and personal component of the biblical legends, Christian history, and religious experience (1, 2, 3, 4).In his \"The Holy Trinity\" only the angels and the radiance of light surrounding the Holy spirit allows us to see the plot point of the phenomenon of the Trinity. The grief of a father mourning his dead son, read and experienced here is stronger and more penetrating than the miracle of the divine essence.In the \"descent from the cross\" Rubens gives physically the viewer to feel the weight of despair – through the physical, lifeless weight of the dead body. Foot of Christ hanging from the cross, placed on the shoulder of Mary Magdalene, one of the porters ate the shroud teeth, the other rests an elbow on the ladder to withstand heavy weight, and the third does not hold and begins to drop his terrible burden. When three days later the dead God resurrect these eight participants being removed from the cross will experience the most powerful spiritual upheaval – they are like no other will remember all my neponjatnostej doubt, the horror of death. They will be the faithful followers of Christ, and after them, and the viewer, emerging from the same fear.The Rubens are very few peaceful and blessed paintings on religious subjects. Baroque, which is just excess that is all overkill, overkill and visibility, for it is here and artistic method, and way of thinking, and view of the world, and the spirit of the time.Author: Anna SidelnikaVA"},{"paintingTitle":"Adam and eve","artistName":"Peter Paul Rubens","artistContentId":216353,"paintingContentId":"aabaae32-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1597, 182.5×140.7 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1200/work/f94/483743.jpg","paintingDescription":"There is still no description of this artwork.

Mythological based paintings by TitianAccording to the myth, Acrisius, the Greek king of Argos, the Oracle of Delphi declared that it will shift his own grandson, whom in the future will give birth to a king's daughter, beautiful Danae. Frightened by the prophecy, Acrisius imprisoned Danae, her being in the tower, where he doesn't get none of the mortals. The beauty of Danae captivated by Zeus. God of thunder penetrated to her in the form of Golden rain. From this context, was born the hero Perseus.Five \"Danaus\" By TitianThe first version of \"Danae\"Titian wrote in 1544-1545, by order of cardinal Alessandro Farnese, one of the richest men in Italy (according to rumors, the model was the mistress of the cardinal, a famous courtesan nicknamed angel). The picture stored in the Naples, Museum of Capodimonte, and differs from all subsequent versions of the cast of characters: all the rest will be old nurse (or maid). In the first version of the heroine was not: instead, at the feet of Danae is Cupid with wings and bow, which is quite logical, given the lifestyle of a model, which was written picture. And the mythical Golden rain acquires in this regard, quite new shades of meaning.The second version of \"Danae\"created about 1553 for the Spanish king Philip II. Here is Cupid's occurs old nurse that Titian will be repeated in all subsequent versions. In many ways, this change has been successful. It allowed Tiziano to enrich the composition of a number of semantic contrasts: youth and old age, beauty and ugliness, the Nude figure and dressed. Subsequently, the \"Danae\" of Philip II decorated the Royal residence, the Alcazar and Buen Retiro, and after the war for independence in the first half of the NINETEENTH century, king Ferdinand VII gave it to the Duke of Wellington, and now the picture is presented at the residence of Wellington Apsley house (London).Two more \"Danae\" – from the collections of the Hermitage(Saint-Petersburg) and Historical and art Museum(Vienna) date back to 1554 and 1564-m, respectively.The fifth \"Danae\" stored in the Prado (the reproduction on the left), written between the years 1560-1565. The quality of execution it surpasses replica from St. Petersburg and Vienna. Experts say that of all the versions this offers the greatest degree of eroticism. In other versions of the legs of Danae covers translucent fabric – here it is missing; the facial expression of the heroine with ajar lips not simply shines a calm serenity, as in the other versions – it is close to ecstatic; Danae's hand rests between her thighs, as if facilitating the access to her body Zeus, falling in a rain of gold coins.Danae and her special, \"the Titian\" colorTransfer the warm glow of sunset, amplifying the intensity of the erotic paintings, skillful use of Titian tones and color of the antithetical, the rejection sharply marked dividing lines create a natural soft colouring, where the hues seem to shimmer in a special way from penetrating them from the inside of the light, which was called the Titian color.The place of \"Danae\" by Titian in the worksRepetition of the same story and the big names of customers testify to the high position which Titian vecelli took in the artistic hierarchy of the period of High Renaissance. Titian was appreciated not only as an unsurpassed master of color, but also as a virtuoso of erotic painting. Tuscan writer of the XVI century Giovanni della Casa says: Danae in the performance of Titian's seductive enough in comparison with its Nude \"Venus Of Urbino\"it seems a nun.

For a young Guidobaldo for reasons of policy was chosen bride Giulia Varano, at the time of creating the painting – a 10-year-old girl. \"Venus of Urbino\" was a wedding gift waiting for when Julia gets older and stronger feelings of love to the spouse. However, it is doubtful whether Titian painted the \"Venus of Urbino\" from a young Varano. There is speculation that his model was the mother of Guidobaldo, Duchess Eleonora Gonzaga: her portrait by Titian dates back to 1538, the same year as the \"Venus of Urbino\", and some resemblance is really there.Symbols and allegories in \"Venus of Urbino\"For wedding picture was necessary attributes, designed to symbolize fidelity, and \"Venus of Urbino\" strictly follows this rule. In the center of the composition is rounded feminine belly, the eternal symbol of childbirth and the continuation of life. Left hand women shyly covers her bosom. White sheets and pillows on which she reclines, to symbolize her purity. Rose hips in the hands and a Myrtle in the window is a traditional allegory of married life; the dog, curled into a circle at the feet symbolizes loyalty.

According to legend, Tiziano managed to save a few paintings by Giorgione from fire: in order to avoid the spread of infection, all the belongings of the victims of the plague were burned. Among the rescued paintings were \"Sleeping Venus\". She shook Titian his extraordinary compositional perfection: an elongated and closed loop female body looked unusual and stunning harmonic perfection. Friends of the deceased artist has repeatedly appealed to Tiziano to restore the affected canvas of Giorgione and finish the ones that weren't finished that Titian did. Later he repeated the composition \"Sleeping Venus\" in his \"Venus of Urbino\" by removing it from the womb of nature into the interior of a rich Venetian houses.

After the execution of the \"Assunta\" (assunta – it. ascended) Titian was recognized as the first painter of the Venetian Republic.\"Our lady of the assumption (the Ascension of our lady)\": history of creationA huge altar was ordered Tiziano father Germano, rector of the Church of the Frari in the year of the victory of the Venetian Republic of St. Mark over the hordes of the Emperor Maximilian. In 1509, the Germans occupied all the continental possessions of Venice, and only in 1516 year, the Republic was able to bring them all under his control, freeing the last of the occupied by the Germans cities – Verona.It is known that Titian did not really want to undertake this work, and the advance for her was handed to him by the Church almost by force. Held in the twentieth century, the radiological analysis showed that the paint layer of the painting is very fine: probably the father of Geromino was so stingy that Tiziano, which is usually written in a sweeping and generous brush strokes, in this case, had to save even on colorful pigments.The festivities on the occasion of the consecration of the \"Assunta\" chroniclers of Venice highlighting the most solemn event in the life of the city in the XVI century. In a magnificent and joyous image of our lady, aspiring to the sky, saw the personification of Venice, defeated the Germans with jubilation and celebrating their triumph.Artistic and compositional features of the painting by Titian \"Assunta (the Ascension of our lady)\"The composite picture is divided into three tiers: the lower (earth), medium (climbing space) and the upper (heavenly). As the distance from the earth changes colors, the background of gray-beige becomes gold. In a stunning painting dominated by the gradation of brown, green, red and Golden colors. In the lower part of the huddled apostles, whose nearly three-meter figures in his great excitement. They built to the sky eyes expressed sorrow, almost despair of parting with the blessed Virgin, and raised their hands to heaven – emotional protest. Extremely sharp the intensity of the feelings transmitted by Titian in the figures of the apostles, was so new to painting that shocked many of his contemporaries: some have argued that instead of the Holy apostles, the artist has depicted \"quarreling conspirators\".In the middle of the picture the virgin Mary, accompanied by many of the cherubim soars to his Heavenly Father. It is full of genuine greatness, joyful solemnity and does not like a timid and meek Madonnas, Titian written earlier. God the Father with two angels crowning the top, \"heavenly,\" tier \"Assunta\".The value of the \"Assunta\" in the context of Venetian and Roman art of the Renaissance\"Ascension of the virgin\" is not just one of the peaks and creativity Titian. \"Assunta\" - truly a new word in Venetian painting, had never been raised to such heights of heroic pathos and civil sound: creative work Carpacciobrothers Bellini and, in particular, Giorgione wore a much more intimate character.

In 1585, the year, nearly a decade after the painter's death, the son of Titian, Pomponio sold his father's house along with all contained therein movable and immovable property there is no one Cristoforo of Padua of a noble kind Barbarigo. Part of that wholesale transactions were and such a masterpiece as \"Saint Sebastian\".The legend of Saint SebastianIn the Basilica of St. Sebastian, located in the heart of the ancient catacombs of Rome, the relics of the legionary captain of the Roman archers, which for firmness in the confession of faith was recognized by the Catholic Church of the Holy Ghost. Sebastian secretly converted to Christianity and is attached to the other of the Gentiles. For this, Emperor Diocletian appointed a terrible penalty: Legionnaire tied to a tree and archers of his cohort had to put in Sebastian's arrows, until he will become, in the words of one Dominican monk, \"in the likeness of a porcupine\". The life says that after that torture Sebastian survived, but was re-sentenced to death by stoning. His mutilated body was found in a roadside ditch Saint Lucia and buried near the Appian way.Artistic originality of a picture of Titian's \"Saint Sebastian\"In a sense, \"Saint Sebastian\" is the result of creative searches of Titian as the greatest colorist. Titian thinks not lines, not volumes and masses of light and shade or the proportions, like the other artists, he plays the world and recreates the form only colors, using the color and tonal relationships. The subtle reflexes of yellow, pink, brown allow for the transfer of the breath and the thrill of living and suffering of the flesh. The alarming color of the picture, where the night is lit by the flames, throwing on the body of the Martyr capricious shaking reflections, and the gloomy apocalyptic earth merges with the black sky allowed the critics to see in this dark canvas, \"a true Symphony of color.\" Interestingly, if in the early and Mature periods of art Titian the main carrier of color performed tissue and interiorin the later period the main relay a colorful sound is the human body, vulnerable and beautiful in its nakedness.The pose of Sebastian tied to a tree, but not broken, not lost dignity and even in the face of impending death is not attractivea of Christ, expresses the profound faith of Titian in the resilience of the human spirit.Author: Anna Yesterday"},{"paintingTitle":"Danae","artistName":"Titian","artistContentId":224833,"paintingContentId":"ab1ea019-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1540-th\n, 120×172 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy800/work/980/228608.jpg","paintingDescription":"There is still no description of this artwork.

Fate was ironic to him, as during his lifetime, he only managed to sell a few works, and his incredible talent did not receive his proper recognition, while today his canvases cost tons of money. Today, his works are the pride of the best world museums, and collectors are willing to pay any money for every auctioned canvas.Among the large number of works created by the brilliant master, a special place belongs to the famous painting \"Sunflowers\", which occupies the minds of several generations of art historians. Despite the worldwide fame of the story, many people do not even realize that the artist has created a series of paintings with sunflowers, which is conditionally divided into two cycles. The first cycle, the Parisian one, includes pictures with lying plants depicted (1, 2, 3, 4). The second cycle was created in Arles; it includes canvases on which flowers are placed into vases (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). \"Sunflowers\" have become a kind of hallmark of Van Gogh. They occupy as important place in his creative heritage, as, for example, \"La Gioconda\" in the oeuvre of Leonardo or the \"Black Square\" in the oeuvre of Malewicz. Vincent is known to paint flowers often. There are his canvases depicting flowering tree branches – apple trees, acacias, almonds, chestnuts. He also liked to draw simple wild flowers – chamomile, poppies, cornflowers and even thistles. However, he felt special feelings for these flowers, he wrote to his brother about it many times. In his letters, the artist admitted that he associates sunflowers with himself. Perhaps it was due to the fact that they are yellow, and this colour is known to be his favourite.This picture, created by Van Gogh in the still life genre in Paris, the master captured cut flowers lying in disorder. Their petals are ruffled and crushed, the image perfectly conveys the convulsive withering of huge inflorescences and thick curved stems. The future of these plants is predetermined, yet the picture surprisingly shows the great internal vitality and resistance to the inevitable fate.The description of the paintings by the Dutch master, which were made in Paris, make a depressive impression, while the cycle of works created a year later in Arles is rather filled with light and joy. This is due to the fact that in the south of France, the artist experienced a great emotional upsurge. He painted these pictures to decorate the walls of his workshop and rooms in his favorite \"yellow house\", where he invited his friend, the painter Paul Gauguin.Van Gogh originally planned to place the still life paintings depicting sunflowers in vases in their common workshop, where both artists were supposed to work together. He wanted to create at least twelve panels with his favorite flowers, but he only had managed to paint four pictures within the summer, despite his great zeal. He hung them in the guest room prepared for Gauguin.Unfortunately, one of the works from the cycle of paintings by Van Gogh, conceived and created in Arles, was irretrievably lost, only its photo remained. This picture was destroyed during the World War II, military operations in Japan. The fate of the other canvases was more successful: one of the works from the cycle, depicting three sunflowers, is stored in one of the private collections in the USA, and two others, the most famous, are in London and Munich. Every original picture by Van Gogh with these flowers has an extremely simple and concise plot: a simple rough vase with huge flowers on a surface. Flowers seem too large and disproportionate to the environment and even to the canvas, which creates the feeling that the petals of flowers are about to push the edges of the picture and penetrate into our real world. The canvases are created in the original \"impasto\" technique, which supposes that the colours are applied very densely, both with a brush, and with a knife and a palette knife. The rough canvas texture makes an illusion that the flowers are not painted on the canvas, but are a bit closer to the viewer, they seem to be moving, changing and swaying from waft of the wind."},{"paintingTitle":"Cows","artistName":"Vincent van Gogh","artistContentId":204915,"paintingContentId":"ab857831-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1890, 55×65 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/orig/work/527/341941.jpg","paintingDescription":"There is still no description of this artwork.

However, it was not an easy road. And there is much more to this oil painting than you probably have heard.\r\nExecuted at the peak of the artist’s powers\r\nVincent van Gogh painted The Starry Night in late June or early July of 1889, a year before his suicide on the wheat fields of Auvers-sur-Oise aged 37. It was the most productive period in his artistic career (1885-1890) that produced a collection of art works reflecting personal vision of the artist and representing his distinctive style full of broad brushstrokes, inventive perspectives, colors, patterns and designs.Three years prior to The Starry Night, in 1886, Vincent van Gogh moved to Paris after his academic classes in Antwerp and discovered Montmartre. He encountered Impressionists, Neo-Impressionists, and the famous Pointillist George Seurat. He was deeply inspired by these artists’ harmonious matching of colors, short brushstrokes, and liberal use of paint. They intensely influenced van Gogh style: he has brightened his own palette and loosened his brushwork, emphasizing the physical application of paint on canvas. The style Vincent developed in Paris and practiced henceforth, was titled as Post-Impressionism, a term referred to art works made by artists interested in expressing their emotional and psychological responses to the world through bold colors and expressive, often symbolic images.By 1888, Vincent van Gogh had returned to the French countryside to escape Parisian urban pressure and remained in the provence until his death. There, once agin close to the peasants who had inspired him while he was living in the Netherlands, he concentrated on painting the landscapes, self-portraits, portraits of other people, domestic interiors, and still lifes full of personal symbolism.\r\nA long-cherished idea\r\nVincent van Gogh conceived of his plan to make a nocturnal landscape long before he actually executed The Starry Night. Prior to it, in 1888, he has already made two canvases featuring starlit skies: The Starry Night Over the Rhône and The Café Terrace At Night. But these paintings showed night as a catchy background rather than made it a protagonist.Vincent kept the subject of a dark blue night sky dotted with the twinkling yellow stars in his mind for many months since he came to Arles. By executing it, he wished to meet new technical challenges—namely to use contrasting colors and to fulfill a complicated task of painting en plein air (outdoors) at night. He repeatedly wrote about his intention in letters to family and friends as of a promising yet problematic theme. “A starry sky, for example, well – it’s a thing that I’d like to try to do, but how to arrive at that unless I decide to work at home and from the imagination?”- the artist shared his hesitancy with the painter Emile Bernard in the spring of 1888.It should be noted here that Vincent Van Gogh often worked en plein air or painted from prints and illustrations. So, the idea of painting an invented scene from imagination was a challenging one to him. His preceding nocturne The Starry Night over the Rhône the artist executed outdoors with help of a gas lamplight. And we see the sky and the river, and the small city of Arles at night just as they are in reality. The Starry Night, though, is a re-working image of a night sky and the landscape of Saint-Rémy beneath it. Art historians claim that when Vincent van Gogh worked on this oil painting, he looked at the nature, grasped its mood, and then reassembled it at his will, depriving of reality yet supplying with his personal emotions. Why so? The story is closely related to the place where the picture was made and to mental condition of the artist at the time.\r\nPlace\r\nThe Starry Night depicts Van Gogh’s view from the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole, an asylum and a clinic for the mentally ill near the village of Saint-Rémy. Vincent was hospitalized here in May 1889 after experiencing a mental breakdown in the winter of 1888. During the infamous seizure, he dramatically ended up his collaboration with a close friend and painter Paul Gauguin and mutilated part of his own ear.To respite from emotional suffering Vincent was encouraged to make art in the asylum. He was given special rights to occupy two rooms: a bedroom on the second floor and a room on the ground floor as a painting studio. So, the sweeping view of the Alpine mountain range from his bedroom window composed the basis for The Starry Night. However, van Gogh wouldn't have been able to see Saint-Rémy from his bedroom window, and art historians assume that he used elements of a few previously completed works still stored in his studio as well as aspects from imagination and memory. Some scholars think that the village on canvas is pulled from one of van Gogh's charcoal sketches of the French town others hold that it was actually inspired by his homeland, the Netherlands. It has even been argued that the church’s spire in the village is somehow more Dutch in character and must have been painted as an amalgamation of several different church spires from his homeland.Anyways, even if those who claim that the canvas was created largely if not exclusively in the studio at the ground floor are right, the artist was at least inspired by the view out of his bedroom window:\"This morning I saw the country from my window a long time before sunrise, with nothing but the morning star, which looked very big.\"\r\nSubject\r\nThe Starry Night attests to the author’s profound interest in the night sky. It evidences his extended observations of the landscape and the star-filled night firmament with curiosity and attenteviness of an astronomer. This was only made possible after leaving Paris, where gas and electric city street lights were increasingly in use by the late nineteenth century. In rural areas of southern France Van Gogh was able to spend hours contemplating stars without their interference.In his letter to Theo, Vincent wrote that the stars always made him dream and in those dreams he saw them “in as simple a way as the black spots on the map, representing towns and villages” as places for dwelling after death. He continued: “Why, I say to myself, should the spots of light in the firmament be less accessible to us than the black spots on the map of France? Just as we take the train to go to Tarascon or Rouen, we take death to go to a star. What’s certainly true in this argument is that while alive, we cannot go to a star, any more than once dead we’d be able to take the train. So it seems to me not impossible that cholera, the stone, consumption, cancer are celestial means of locomotion, just as steamboats, omnibuses and the railway are terrestrial ones. To die peacefully of old age would be to go there on foot.”Who knows, maybe when Van Gogh has been looking up on a starry sky and painting his iconic work he looked for the place to move to in a year? And his suicide was another kind of “a celestial means of locomotion” to get there…\r\nColor\r\nVincent van Gogh has always paid much attention to color. In a letter to his sister Willemien, discussing with her the mind and temperament of artists, he wrote that he was “very sensitive to color and its particular language, its effects of complementaries, contrasts, harmony.” A starry night’s palette amazed him deeply. In another letter to Weillemien he spoke about its colors: “It often seems to me that the night is even more richly colored than the day, colored with the most intense violets, blues and greens. If you look carefully, you’ll see that some stars are lemony, others have a pink, green, forget-me-not blue glow. And without labouring the point, it’s clear to paint a starry sky it’s not nearly enough to put white spots on blue-black.”Van Gogh followed his own advice, and showed in his Starry Night a wide variety of colors he perceived on clear nights.\r\nComposition\r\nA night sky filled with a moon and the stars acts as a protagonist in this original painting. It takes up three-quarters of the picture plane and draws all our attention to its turbulent, even agitated state with help of intensely swirling patterns rolling across its surface like waves. Among the many bright orbs there are two appartent accents in the sky—the crescent moon to the far right, and Venus, the morning star, to the left of center—surrounded by concentric circles of radiant white and yellow light.The composition is very expressive and well-balanced at the same time. Countless short signature brushstrokes and thickly applied paint set the surface of the oil painting in a roiling motion. However, the ordered placement of the cypress, a steeple, and the central nebulae structures the composition and equalizes it. Such a combination of visual contrasts makes the accent on the juxtaposition of an active cosmos night life to a restful earthly sleep. Van Gogh was much more interested in the night and found more beauty in it than in a hustle-bustle day. For him, it was “much more alive and richly colored than the day.”\r\nStyle\r\nVincent Van Gogh regarded The Starry Night to be an exercise in deliberate stylization. He wrote his brother Theo: “These are exaggerations from the point of view of arrangement, their lines are contorted like those of ancient woodcuts”. So, Van Gogh’s style in here was inspired in part by medieval woodcuts, with their thick outlines and simplified forms, and is quite similar to the artistic manner of his friends Bernard and Gauguin.\r\nMatching to astronomical data\r\nIn 1985, an art historian Albert Boime compared The Starry Night to a planetarium recreation of the night sky in Provence in the summer of 1889. The similarities were striking, and proved that the brightest “morning star”, placed right of the cypress tree, is actually the planet Venus. Researchers have determined that it was indeed visible at dawn at the time. Van Gogh’s stylized moon, however, is astronomically incorrect. The records indicate that the moon actually was waning gibbous, not waning crescent, as he depicted it. The whirling forms in the sky, on the other hand, match published astronomical observations of clouds of dust and gas known as nebulae.\r\nMark on art history\r\nMentioned briefly by Vincent in his letter to Theo as a simple “study of night” or ”night effect,” The Starry Night is highly appreciated by modern art critics for its rich mixture of invention, remembrance, and observation. Its unique composition combined with simplified forms, thick impasto, and boldly contrasting colors, made the work compelling to subsequent generations of viewers as well as to other artists.Inspiring and encouraging others is precisely what Vincent van Gogh sought to achieve with his night scenes. The Starry Night became a foundational image for Expressionism as well as perhaps the most famous painting in the artist’s oeuvre.   Author:Natalia Korchina                                                                                                                                                "},{"paintingTitle":"Twelve sunflowers in a vase","artistName":"Vincent van Gogh","artistContentId":204915,"paintingContentId":"ab857833-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"August 1888, 91×71 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1200/work/9c4/294363.jpg","paintingDescription":"The first year of life in Arles was Vincent year of the yellow color.

But especially Vincent was mesmerized by the endless fields of sunflowers, which in Arles and flower do not consider growing them for the production of oil.Autumn van Gogh was looking forward to the arrival Paul Gauguin who agreed to live with him.

However, it is unlikely that he knew Gauguin settled in the \"Yellow house\" in exchange for material assistance promised Theo.

Unknown, did van Gogh to fully implement the plan, and there enough place for him, but in any case, for the first time crossed the threshold of his room, Gauguin saw a very psychedelic image. Mental impulse colleagues, he was not appreciated and just took all the sunflowers on the walls. For Vincent, it did not seem too bothered, and his love for sun flowers was not affected. He made several copies of the \"Fifteen sunflowers\" and decades later made this flower in one of the most famous pictorial images.

During the life in the French capital, Vincent van Gogh painted three portrait of Père Tanguy. Second and the third (described here) the fabric is very similar in style and composition, but very different from first created to Dating Vincent with Japanese art.Paintings of the Paris period are United by one interesting feature – they are not similar to each other. Vincent as if trying to \"taste\" one style, then another, from realism to impressionism, then – to pointillism. He is constantly experimenting, while maintaining a subtle awareness and personality. Sometimes van Gogh writes three paintings a day. And here we should thank the Father of Tanga (and of course, Theo, tirelessly supplied the brother's money). Julien Tanguy had a store on the street closely, where they sold paints, brushes and paintings. Paintings, which years later were worth a fortune, got him almost for free. Very often young and poor artists Tanguy gave unlimited credit for the purchase of art supplies, and even fed them. Shop father's Tangi for a long time was the only place where you can see and buy strictly on price list (large – one hundred francs, small – forty) works Cezanne. One of the main beliefs of the Thong was: \"The artist who behaves with dignity, are sure to succeed\". Vincent, who at the time was addicted to absinthe and rarely behaved with dignity, success clearly is not threatened, but the Father Tanguy eccentric Dutchman liked. And van Gogh, in turn, liked anyone who showed the slightest interest in his work. He gladly gave the shopkeeper his paintings, and instead had the opportunity to take as much paint as he needed.On the second and third portraits of Père Tanguy, Vincent was surrounded by his Oriental prints: Fuji, cherry blossoms and Kabuki actors. In this period van Gogh was just fond of Japanese painting, which influenced all his future work. The East was purchased and the face of famous shopkeeper (he is often compared with good-natured Buddha).Author: Eugene Sidelnikov"},{"paintingTitle":"Flowering almond","artistName":"Vincent van Gogh","artistContentId":204915,"paintingContentId":"ab857838-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"February 1890, 73.3×92.4 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy800/work/8a2/294510.jpg","paintingDescription":"There is still no description of this artwork.

Today it rivals only Sunflowers and Starry Night in terms of popularity. Due to its unusual depiction of a starry sky, the Café Terrace At Night echoes other paintings by the artist executed during the same period: Starry Night Over the Rhône and Portriat of Eugene Boch. Stars on these canvases are more like miniature flowers which in a year would produce ‘sunflower’ luminaries and spiral whirls of the Starry Night.Vincent dreamt of producing a nocturnal landscape long before his move to Arles. Another canvas where he features starlit skies is the Starry Night Over the Rhône, created in the same month as the Café Terrace At Night. There is a legend saying that Vincent van Gogh put candles in his straw hat to have enough light to paint this work on the spot at night. In a letter to his sister Wilhelmina, he wrote about this canvas: “Here you have a night picture without any black in it, done with nothing but beautiful blue and violet and green, and in these surroundings the lighted square acquires a pale sulphur and greenish citron-yellow colour. It amuses me enormously to paint the night right on the spot.”The artist painted the setting directly from his observations, right from the street at night. This practice he inherited from the Impressionists. However, unlike them, he did not render the scene merely as his eye observed it, but rather enlivened the image with his individual psychological reaction on it. His brushstrokes vibrate with the sense of excitement which Van Gogh experienced while painting the canvas.By using contrasting colors and tones – dark-blue, green, violet and bright yellow – Vincent achieved a luminous surface that pulses with an intensive interior light. As an electric sun on the darkening sky does it shine on the nocturnal background. The lines of composition all point directly to the center of the work where a horse and a carriage are standing, drawing the eye along the pavement as if the viewer is strolling the cobblestone streets. However, the terrace, bathed in greenish citron-yellow light, attracts our attention even more than the objects on the vanishing point. Like being drawn into a vortex, we cannot take our eyes off it. And yet the overall balance of the tones in the painting suggests static equilibrium and tranquility.More than one hundred years after Vincent depicted it, the Cafe Terrace is still in Arles at the same place. It's now called the «Le Café de la Nuit» (Cafe Van Gogh) by some farseeing owner. It has been remodeled to appear as it did more than a century ago: walls painted yellow with a yellow-lit awning. However, tourists who visited Arles in search of the famous terrace, will found themselves gravely disappointed. According to feedback from visitors, it’s a nice stop-off to take a picture, no more than that. Anyways, despite its high prices and the fact that services and quality of cuisine left much to be desired, flow of tourists still remains unchanged.Vincent van Gogh's works were often inspired by literary references. The artist found the description of a similar café in the book Bel Ami by Guy de Maupassant and told his sister Wil about it, \" . . . a starlit night in Paris with the brightly lighted cafes of the Boulevard, and this is approximately the same subject I just painted.\" It needs to remark here that scholars state that Vincent was mistaken – in fact, the Maupassant reference he was thinking of is found in the novel Yvette.Café Terrace At Night is one of those art works that give us food for thought. An independent researcher Jared Baxter suggested that this masterpiece might contain a homage to Leonardo da Vinci’s The Last Supper (1495-98). For him, a close study of the painting reveals that the main characters include one central figure with long hair surrounded by 12 individuals, plus a figure departing in the shadows. A longhaired figure, who is wearing a white tunic or an apron as the café’s waitress, he parallels to Jesus, 12 visitors – to the Apostles, and the figure in the doorstep he calls Judas. Theory of Baxter is backed by a number of experts, including the art historian Bill Kloss. All of them insist on close attention to details, namely to a number of crosses featuring in the painting. The most crucial one, formed by the muntin of a window, is placed right behind the central, longhaired figure."},{"paintingTitle":"Portrait of a young woman in a straw hat in the wheat","artistName":"Vincent van Gogh","artistContentId":204915,"paintingContentId":"ab85783a-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"June 1890, 92×73 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1200/work/be9/297231.jpg","paintingDescription":"There is still no description of this artwork.

In this house he rented four rooms, one of which he lived himself, and secondly, soon settled Paul Gauguin. Another room was probably reserved for the Studio in which the artist worked in rainy days. Only van Gogh painted three versions of \"Bedroom in Arles\" (second, third). Composite video is no different, the difference is only in shades, that uses Vincent, and the paintings hanging on the bedroom wall. Of course, this painting by van Gogh himself. The decor of the room is quite modest, even meager, not least due to its size. However, Vincent seems to not need too many things for a happy life.1. Picture in pictureAbove the headboard hangs a painting, which remains unchanged in all three versions of \"Bedroom in Arles\" - \"Boulders and oak\" written by Vincent in Arles in the summer of 1888. This work was one of the favorite paintings of his brother Theo.2. Other avtoritetyRight above the bed you can see the portraits painted by Vincent. Some of them are easily recognizable. In the first embodiment of the picture it portraits Eugene Boschand Lieutenant Mille. On the second guess one of the self portraits of van Gogh. And the third (which is a copy of the second) these works are drawn much more clearly, and here already precisely it is possible to determine that one of them self-portrait 1889 and the second is an unidentified portrait of a woman (possibly Madame Geno).3. ClosetBehind the headboard on the far wall hung favorite blue blouse by van Gogh, who, according to the memoirs of contemporaries, he always wore at work. Here – the famous straw hat, painted several self-portraits (1, 2, 3). With its help, Vincent not only saved from the hot summer sun, but, according to some, is fastened on her field of candles, working on night landscapes.4. ChairsBecause of the small size of the furniture in the room: bed, dressing table and two matching chairs. One of these chairs Vincent devoted a separate picture, which is often mentioned in conjunction with \"Gauguin's Chair\". Lonely chair with its pipe and tobacco once again becomes van Gogh a symbol of absence, of something irretrievably gone, lost.5. MirrorTo the left of the window above the vanity hangs a small mirror. Apparently, it was to this mirror Vincent tried to cut off his ear on Christmas eve 1888. Found van Gogh at first, police thought he was dead: around the house was left bloody footprints, and the room of the artist they found full of blood in the pelvis (probably the same one that can be seen on the table) and himself unconscious.Despite how tragically ended the life of Vincent in the Yellow house, this room for a while became his sanctuary, his happy place. Telling brother about the painting \"Bedroom in Arles\", the artist writes: \"The whole thing is in color, making it easier which I attach to objects more style, so that they made me think about rest and sleep at all. The look needs to calm the brain, or rather, the imagination\".Author: Eugene Sidelnikov"},{"paintingTitle":"Agostina Segatori in the cafe \"Tambourine\"","artistName":"Vincent van Gogh","artistContentId":204915,"paintingContentId":"ab85783d-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"March 1887, 55.5×46.5 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy1200/work/ea5/277692.jpg","paintingDescription":"In 1886, Vincent left his native country and moved to Paris, \"under the wing\" to the beloved brother Theo. The latter was not too happy about this turn of events, but considered it his duty always and everywhere to support Vincent. Theo drove his brother in a Bohemian institution, acquainted with young and promising artists and has continued to provide it with all necessary for painting. Together the brothers became interested in Japanese painting and became an obsession to buy prints and gifts. Many of the works of van Gogh in that period are of a Japanese print, these include the portrait \"Agostina Segatori in the cafe \"Tambourine\".Lush Italian Agostina Segatori, which opened on the Boulevard de Clichy restaurant-cabaret for artists, was also the Muse and model of the Paris painters, not burdened with riches. In addition to \"brand\" the tables and chairs in the shape of tambourines cabaret distinguished notoriety, and decent people avoided it. But for the poor artists \"Tambourine\" became a second home. Burning southern appearance Agostini allowed them to turn her into the heroine of a variety of exotic subjects. And, of course, many of the artists were delighted to have with a woman, and a much more intimate relationship, and she often graciously took their courtship. Fell victim to her charms and Vincent. Mature woman, whose face bore the imprint of a rich life experience was completely to his taste. They had a short and passionate affair. On one of the paintings van Gogh Agostina is depicted fully Nudeth, shamelessly lying on the bed. The finished canvas face blurred, but preliminary sketch leaves no doubt as to the identity of the model. At the beginning of the Japanese period, van Gogh made copies of the engravings, and later he began to write in this style. His work Vincent was very proud of, and even staged an exhibition in the \"Tambourine\". One of them can be seen behind the woman in this portrait Agostini. In addition, the chair next to it is a Japanese umbrella, most likely donated by Vincent.Author: Eugene Sidelnikov"},{"paintingTitle":"The sower in sunset light","artistName":"Vincent van Gogh","artistContentId":204915,"paintingContentId":"ab859f40-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"November 1888, 73×92 cm • Oil, Canvas","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy800/work/1be/436679.gif","paintingDescription":"There is still no description of this artwork.

Dr. ray was caring for Vincent throughout the 15 days, which he spent in the hospital, and after discharge went to visit him in Yellow house.

Later, ray said: \"When I saw that he outlined my head in green (he had only two main colors – green and red), and hair and whiskers painted red, and all this on a poisonous green background, I was terrified\". The doctor admitted that the picture he never liked me. And was waiting for her unenviable fate.

But van Gogh here appears for the first time a private Studio set in the former Laundry room behind my parents ' house. Most good people look at Nuenen Vincent down, someone at the meeting in disgust gives him only one finger instead of open palm.Winter could not improve the mood of the artist, every day surround and surround yourself all over the wall of solitude. Landscapes Nuenen, and without that not too picturesque and joyful, become very bleak. Vincent sees around only dirt, some places covered with miserable scraps of snow, black branches of trees and dry grass. But van Gogh does not allow himself to fully immerse in a black melancholy, and begins to paint portraits of peasants, and planning over the winter to create 50 paintings. He moves with such zeal that in only a month says three dozen paintings. Later the heads of the peasants will become the basis for his first notable work – \"The potato eaters\".Poor family, depicted van Gogh, dinner with a weak light bulb, potatoes and coffee. And it is unlikely that this meal is too different from many previous and subsequent. Poor decoration of the house, dark colors and rough the faces of the characters in the movie produced dismal. But this is exactly what Vincent wanted. In a letter to his brother Theo, he wrote: \"The whole winter I kept the thread of the future of the fabric and picked up a distinctive pattern, and although the fabric I got at the raw and rough, the threads were selected carefully and in accordance with defined rules. It is possible that I went a real peasant painting. He who prefers to see the peasants sugary, let him think what he wants.

A mother who cared for Warhol, was looking for any ways to entertain and distract the boy, but most of all he was like coloring books. For each page, neatly painted Julia gave his son a piece of chocolate. Many years later Andy will write his first painting in which, as in all subsequent unmistakable echoes of his childhood love of coloring. Clearly delineated black outlines and region, exactly filled with pure color, became one of the main features of the artist.Warhol began work on diptych \"Marilyn\" in August 1962, a week after the suicide of Marilyn Monroe. This sad event made the artist think about the American cult of celebrity and how this cult transformered and continues to exist after the death of a star. This idea is embodied in the form of huge canvases with 50 portraits of the actress: half of them brightly painted, the other half black and white, and some images as if deliberately \"spoiled\", too pale or too dark. Based on the famous Warhol took a publicity shot of Marilyn from the movie \"Niagara\" 1952, but some black-and-white portraits on the right side of the canvas resemble the death mask of the actress. Art historian and critic Camille Paglia in her book \"Glittering Images\" I noticed that the work of Warhol is the best displays of \"plurality of values\" of the life and legacy of Marilyn Monroe.Andy Warhol was one of the first artists to use screen printing in their work. For this he was, by the way, deserve a lot of criticism from critics, as the painting assumed a more close and prolonged contact of the artist with the material used. Works of art are literally stamped one after another. The use of screen printing forms allowed Warhol to produce dozens of the same paintings in a short time. In addition, as in the case of portraits of Marilyn and other characters of his works using this technique it was possible to create different versions of the same image using a variety of color compositions. The first such series were portraits of Monroe, and later Warhol began to use this method with other paintings.Author: Eugene Sidelnikov"},{"paintingTitle":"Sandro Botticelli, Birth Of Venus, 1482","artistName":"Andy Warhol","artistContentId":229251,"paintingContentId":"abf10b42-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1984, 81.3×111.8 cm • Watercolor, Serigraphy, Paper","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/oy800/work/133/438519.jpg","paintingDescription":"There is still no description of this artwork.

The theme of death, disappearance and death as transformation and life after death passes through all the work of the artist. The series, under the General title \"Big electric chair\" is part of a massive cycle of Warhol's \"Death and disaster\", which he began building in 1962. These pictures showing the pain and suffering was something entirely new, radically different from dollar bills, or cans of soup, but they miraculously carried the same idea as all other work of the artist. Death was the same everyday part of American life, like a bottle of Coca-Cola.All of the paintings from the series \"Death and disaster\" Andy used photos from Newspapers. One of the first works of this cycle was a copy of the front page of the newspaper with a photo of a car accident. It was followed by images of suicides, riots, nuclear mushroom cloud, airplane crashes and automobile accidents (1, 2). Portraits of Marilyn Monroe, he began to draw only after the death of the actress. In his work \"Sixteen jackies\" happy photo of a smiling Jacqueline Kennedy full of sorrow interspersed with images of the funeral of the President. The reason for the passion of Warhol's theme of death was not only its constant presence in everyday life, but also how we are able to distance themselves from its impact. \"When you again and again I see terrible pictures- said the artist - they cease to have effect on you\".A series of works with the electric chair Warhol began in 1964. The basis for it was the newspaper picture of the news in 1953 about two executions in the prison of sing sing: then the electric chair sent Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for spying for the Soviet Union. Other works from the series \"Death and disaster\" series with the electric chair is distinguished by one important feature: in these paintings there is not one person. Time seems to be frozen in anticipation of the imminent crash, the air around the \"chair of death\" seems thick and viscous. In the emptiness and stillness of the room, Warhol managed to portray death as the absence of life and the oppressive silence.Author: Eugene Sidelnikov"},{"paintingTitle":"Portrait Of Gertrude Stein","artistName":"Andy Warhol","artistContentId":229251,"paintingContentId":"abf10b46-4e3e-11e8-9214-8fd432febfc2","paintingInfo":"1980 • Serigraphy, Museum Board","paintingImageUrl":"https://arthive.com/res/media/img/orig/work/976/437879.jpg","paintingDescription":"There is still no description of this artwork.
