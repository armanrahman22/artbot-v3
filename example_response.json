            "paintingDescription": "April 26, 1937 on Guernica, a historical and cultural center of the Basque Country, all hell broke loose. Around 16:30 began a two hour bombardment of the German Legion \"Condor\". It was followed by a large-scale fire, turning Guernica into ruins. According to various sources, the bombardment claimed the lives of several hundred to several thousand people. Worst of all is the fact that most of the victims were women and children, since most of the male population at that time was involved in the fighting of the Spanish Civil war. Tragic news from the homeland are unable to leave Picasso has repeatedly stated his apolitical, indifferent. At that time the artist worked on a canvas for the Spanish pavilion at the upcoming world exhibition in Paris. After learning about the bombing of Guernica, the artist instantly changes the concept and takes on a new painting, which became one of the most powerful artistic and political statements in history.\"Guernica\"Picasso became a perpetual reminder of the horrors of war and one of the most famous anti-war symbols. A monumental painting measuring about four by eight meters, was written in record time (work on the painting took Picasso's little more than a month - from 1 may to 4 June), featuring not abstract heroes on the battlefield, whose exploits will be sung repeatedly. Picasso writes of ordinary people, whose names do not write in the history books, but they at all times become the true victims of any war. The artist chose to \"Guernica\" a black and white palette, and even pure white here, there is only different shades of gray. For Picasso the world, which saw a wheel war is a world without colors, the world I left behind life itself.There are many interpretations of the paintings, which are often at odds with each other. In particular, this applies to the depicted on the canvas of a bull and a horse. Some critics argued that the painting should not be taken as a political statement, since the image of the bull or the Minotaur symbolizes here in the first place the ego of Picasso himself. However, commenting on the painting, the artist said that the bull is the evil and cruelty which embodiment before and during the Second World war was fascism. According to Picasso's wounded horse represents the residents of Guernica, the victims and the victims in the massacre. But, despite the obvious gloom of the canvas and the horror that it inspires, the artist leaves his characters and the viewer hope in the form of peacefullyburning lamp under the shade. Picasso once said that \"the light in the picture is the peace that will eternally strive for every living being\".Author: Eugene Sidelnikov"

            "paintingDescription": "Absinthe is hard to call simply an alcoholic beverage. Despite the fact that he has such a long history, such as wine, absinthe has earned the right to be called a unique phenomenon in world culture. \"The green fairy\" (or, according to Paul Verlaine, \"the green witch\") sang, among others, Arthur Rimbaud, Oscar Wilde, Ernest Hemingway, immortalized in their paintings of Edgar Degas, Edouard Manet, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Vincent van Gogh and others (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). But when it comes to talking about the attitude of this drink to painting, to mind almost comes first \"The absinthe drinker\" Pablo Picasso.The young Spaniard was lucky to live in Paris in a time when it was possible to fully taste all the delights of Bohemian life, including trips to brothels in the company of impoverished artists and unhindered use of absinthe. But in the French capital, Picasso will move only in 1904, but in the meantime he shuttles regularly between Paris and Barcelona, working hard, and suffering from lack of money and insecurity. \"The absinthe drinker\" is born precisely in this period, which at all desire can not be called happy. In 1903 Picasso will write \"Portrait of angel Fernandez de Soto\"whose character is depicted at atable before a glass of absinthe. In 1912, the artist will once again perpetuate a drink in a cubist work \"Bottle of Pernod and glass\". And finally, in 1914, a year before \"the green fairy\" was banned in France, Picasso creates a sculpture \"Glass of absinthe\". Prior to the legalization of the drink in European countries, the artist did not survive.\"The absinthe drinker\" is not an original story. Lonely people in the café to Picasso and, after him, was depicted by many artists. However, it was performed by the Spanish artist, this trivial scene takeson the imprint of great drama. In the paintings \"blue period\"Picasso repeatedly to depict people, like the heroine of this painting (\"Twoacrobats (harlequin and his girlfriend)\", 1901, \"Woman with chignon\", 1901, \"A man and a woman at the table\", 1903). Moreover, lovers of absinthe at the table during this period, he will seat twice 1, 2.The woman described the paintings sitting in the corner of the backgrounda dirty-red walls and, on the one hand, it seems completely self-absorbed, and with another – gives the impression of a compressed spring. The surrounding space as if around her, and she wraps herself unnaturally long fingers, as if to occupy as little space as possible. This effect of \"invisibility\" only enhances the sense of abandonment, loneliness among the crowd, which for once in my life felt most people.Author:Eugene Sidelnikov"

            "paintingDescription": "Since 1905, the mood of Picasso’s paintings has changed noticeably. The artist almost recovered from the suicide of his friend Casagemas, and brightness finally entered his life. Changes occurred gradually, and the more joyful moments Picasso experienced, the more life appeared in his works. First of all, this affected the color scheme of the paintings: warm, muted colors, red, pink, orange and brown replaced the cold shades of blue and grey. However, Picasso preferred pink, which gave the name to the new period in his work.\nPicasso’s Girl On The Ball can be called a kind of synthesis of the blue and pink periods. In a surprising way, it combines the elusive anxiety of the first, and the easy serenity of the second. It is like a clash of the past and the future at one point, a visible transformation of Picasso’s creative methods and techniques. The contradiction is enhanced by using two different color palettes and opposing the main subjectsof the picture.\nThe young gymnast girl wearing close bluish-grey tights, seems to be the continuation of the ball on which she balances, the curves of her body repeat its form. While the instability of her pose is more like a game, she seems to float in the air, barely touching the ball with her toes. In contrast, the athlete, pictured in the foreground, practically grows in the ground. The imposing cube on which he sits and the angular, powerful figure of the man literally turn him into the personification of stability. However, there is an invisible linkbetween the characters of the canvas, despite all their dissimilarity, accentuated with the help of color. In the end, it becomes clear thatthey both constitute an ideal harmony of equilibrium, where one is impossible without the other."

Most of her portraits painted in a recognizable style of late Picasso painting \"Jacquelinewith flowers\" - one of the most striking works of this period. Most often, the artist portrayed his second wife that's right: in profile, with huge almond-shaped eyes, and unnaturally long neck and triangular cat-like face (1, 2).It was, incidentally, the favorite pose of her forposing. In particular, it is the woman depicted in the famous series of \"Odalisque\".

It was created in 1937, when Europe was shaken by forebodings of a great war. In Spain,the native country of the artist, already raging war, under the impression which Picasso wrote his \"Guernica\". Some critics believe that \"Weeping woman\" is its continuation.Presumably, the model for the painting was the painter's lover — Dora Maar. It was for Picasso his \"Weeping woman\" embodied all the pain of mothers and wives who lost their loved ones in the flames of war. Dora was the daughter of Croatian architect and was also a professional photographer. On her pictures is dominated by clochard, cripples and beggars; removing them, Dora has created a kind of surreal photopost, where beauty was combined with the deformity, and luxury to poverty. Picasso met Dora in a period of creative crisis, found in her his Muse, which became for him an intellectual outlet and helped to find their own style. Portrayed Picasso's \"Weeping woman\" bright, contrasting colors that highlight the grief and despair of the character of his paintings. Bizarre hat done in bright red and dark blue shades. It is surmounted by a flower-bow, beneath which you can see the bangs. Lemon yellow tone of the wall at the back enhances the feeling of anxiety. The woman depicted in the painting, dressed in the dark, her face an unhealthy greenish tint. She's not holding back his sobs, hands clutching a handkerchief in order to convey the strength of her suffering, the artist has depicted him in the form of a grayish broken pieces, through which Shine the lips and chin of a woman. Special attention has eyes that are \"presented\" Picasso \"Weeping woman\": they're like two faded buttons, criss-cross sewn black thread on a dark background. When you look at the painting involuntarily ask a question: what is mourning this poor, what a blow she gave fate? The answer is no...Picasso's painting \"Weeping woman\" is not the only existing variant. The artist is very often turned to this theme, depicting women crying.

The version presented on this page are held at the art catalog of the works of Picasso at number 12.Today the painting is exhibited at the Tate gallery in London.

Picasso this surrealist - period,including \"Nude in a red armchair\"distinguish flowing \"melted\" contours and remarkably candid, even shocking depiction of the female form. However, Picasso never considered himself to the movement of the Surrealists: his personality and some earthiness did not allow him to submit to their favorite Freudian concept of the superiority of the unconscious. However, related to surrealism, the Dada, still believed the artist's \"own\", they published a reproduction Les demoiselles d'avignonin his Manifesto of 1925, thus acknowledging his influence on their work.The painting \"Nude in a red armchair\" was completed in may 1929. While Surrealists took the idea of what is ugly and repulsive images can pave the way to the unconscious. The picture quite clearly designed to shock the audience, according to one version, was written under the influence Salvador Daliand Joan Miro. Other critics see the choice of color and pattern Wallpaper on the background of a kind of mockery of the work Henri Matisse. All converge only in one: the canvas depicts the Russian wife of Picasso – a former dancer Olga Khokhlovathe relationship of the artist with which at that time was already on the verge of breaking. Special indignation of the painting caused among feminists. They had accused Picasso that his work depicting the female body as a symbol of submission and humiliation (hard to argue, given how evolved the relationship of the artist with all his women). Here, the depersonalization and devaluation reaches its climax: according to critics, the mouth of the heroine of the picture more like a sexual organ, topped with predatory teeth. The sharp contrast between red and green and emphasized the calm sea outside the window only reinforce the feeling of tension that fills the room.It is believed that the negative influence on the work of Picasso had a breakup with Olga, and an affair with a 17-year-old Marie-Therese Walter. But do not forget that at the time of writing, painting artist was 48 years old and highly unlikely to have been spared the inherent age crises.Author: Eugene Sidelnikov"

            "paintingDescription": "In 1898, Picasso finally said goodbye to him a bored Royal Academy of fine arts and returned from Madrid to Barcelona. That was where the real life! Creative freedom, the first solo exhibition in the famous cafe \"Four cat\" and like-minded friends with whom you can discuss art and go on a binge in the brothels. The closest of them was the same age as Picasso, artist Carlos Casagemas. Theywere practically inseparable, and Pablo tried to support a friend suffering from unrequited love. But all has ended tragically: Carlos triedto shoot a girl who didn't reciprocate, after which he committed suicide.After this sad event in the works of Picasso starts permeated with the melancholy \"blue period\". The artist for the rest of his days blaming himself for his friend's death and believed that they could prevent the suicide of Casagemas. In 1901, he paints several paintings, depicting Carlos in the coffin (1, 2), but critics find similar facial features and the heroes of the later paintings of Picasso. Whatever it was, the death of a friend affected the artist so much that he escaped only by work, splashing on the canvas of depression and despair. Almost all the paintings \"blue period\" carry this invisible imprint of death. Was no exception and Picasso \"The old guitarist\".At first glance, this work creates the impression that a blind musician is depicted at the moment when he quietly breathed his last before he could finish the song until the end. He's spooky, almost merging with the background, his unnatural bent shape sheared off or the agony of death, and an agony of longing. Dark colors only enhances this effect. Alive on the canvas seems just a guitar: the viewer almost hears a shrill, gut-wrenching soul inside out chords. It is noteworthy that in \"the Old guitarist\"under a layer of paint emerges a ghostly woman's face. At that period Picasso was not always able to find the money for a new canvas, so I was forced to write one picture on top of another.In 1937 the American poet Wallace Stevens wrote the poem \"the man with the blue guitar,\" which is considered the dedication of \"the Old guitarist\". The poetic dialogue between the musician and his listeners Wallace gives in wordsthe belief of Picasso that art is a lie that helps us see the truth.Author: Eugene Sidelnikov"

            "paintingDescription": "Ambroise Vollard was one of the greatest art dealers of the 20th century. In different years, he supported Cézanne, Van Gogh, Renoir, Gauguin and Matisse. After Picasso had moved to Paris and began to work there, he got under Vollard’s wing. Vollard sold the paintings of the blue and pink periods, but he was rather sceptical and cautious about the Cubist works by Picasso. Later, when the artist returned to the figurative painting, the art dealer made him a very tempting offer. In exchange for several paintings by Renoir and Cézanne, the artist made 100 etchings, mostly mythological and erotic, united into the Vollard Suite. It took seven years for Picasso to complete them in 1937, two more years were spent to print 230 full copies of the series. However, in 1939, Vollard died in a car crash, and the beginning of the Second World War postponed the final release of the Suite for another ten years.Picasso once said, “The most beautiful woman whoever lived never had her portrait painted, drawn, or engraved more often than Vollard – by Cézanne, Renoir, Rouault, Bonnard... But my cubist portrait of him is the best of all.” This self-confident statement flattered not only the artist himself, but, in fact, also Vollard. Some art critics believe that the manner in which Picasso portrayed the art dealer, implies the presence of Vollard’s remarkable mind, which makeshim part of an elite group that understands Cubism. The huge head of the man in the picture is like a broken egg, repeated multiple times, consisting of many fragments; it rises like a massive dome over the body. According to Picasso’s vision, only such a head was capable of accommodating Vollard’s outstanding brain.The Portrait of Ambroise Vollard reminds of a monumental architectural structure, moulded from dissimilar shards of irregular shape. This effect is enhanced by the background color of the picture. Picasso depicted Vollard himself as a calm and pacified almighty god, placed in this close stone space and being a part of it at the same time."

            "paintingDescription": "It took four attempts for Pablo Picasso to win over Paris. Prior to that, he visited the capital of European art three times, where he brought his paintings, trying to sell them, but each time he was in for a cruel disappointment. Going to Paris, Picasso was confident that critics and viewers would instantly appreciate his undeniable genius. However, the paintings were not sold for some reason. The critics took the works of the young Spaniard favorably, but they noted the lack of his individual style. The artist was terribly offended, and it can be said that all his further creative searches and experiments were a struggle for this very individuality and proof of his uniqueness.The main themes of the blue period in the work of Picasso were poverty, hunger and suffering. He painted people caught in the underclass, unhappy, maimed and desperate. In fact, in these works, the artist expressed his own privations: during his life in Paris, he suffered from lack of money, he had nowhere to live, and sometimes he had nothing to eat. His depressed state was aggravated by the loss of his close friend Carlos Casagemas, who committed suicide because of unhappy love. The Old Jew and a Boy picture can be called the embodiment of allthe Picasso’s sufferings of those years. Here we can see the climax of the triumph of blue shades, the artist only slightly dilutes them with yellow to emphasize the painful pallor of the characters’ skin.The hungry face of the old man and his distorted proportions make one recallthe subjects of El Greco’s paintings. However, there is something much more important behind the sensation of grief and despair: the characters of the picture are not alone, even in poverty and hunger they find the strength to support each other. During his life in Barcelona, often wandering around the local shantytowns, Picasso surely saw impoverished Jews and empathized with them. Perhaps that’s why he chose the image of the Jewish old man for this powerful work. In the 1990s, American writer and journalist Norman Mailer pointedly defined this picture quite precisely in his biographical book Portrait of Picasso as A Young Man, “Who has ever given us more intense portraits of concentration campvictims before half of them were even born?”"

            "paintingDescription": "In 1904, Pablo Picasso met his first perennial muse, Fernanda Olivier. She was a tall red-haired beauty, instantly attracting attention and more hothead than ardent young Spaniards. In the future, by the way, Picasso would take mostly low and submissive women as his life partners. Relationship of Pablo and Fernanda lasted seven years. They were stormy, full of jealousy and even violence. But all this only fueled the artist’s inspiration, and he painted his beloved a lot and did it passionately.Fernanda frequently visited Bateau-Lavoir, a building inhabited by young poor artists, because she earned her living by sitting. Fate was not very supportive to her: she was an illegitimate child, brought up by her mother and uncle, who planned to marry the girl when she grew up. She escaped from the house and married a man who was cruel to her. The girl again had to flee: at the age of 19 she moved to Paris and changed her name so that her husband could not find her. Here she quickly got acquainted with artists and writers and made friends with Guillaume Apollinaire. A few years later, Fernanda met Picasso, and from that time, he claimed the exclusive right to paint her portraits. They never got married, because officially Olivier was still married.It wasn’t that easy to be Picasso’s muse. Bright and beautiful Fernanda, accustomed to the admiration reflected in the pictures of other artists, hardly understood the style experiments of Picasso. With the beginning of their relationship, the blue period in his work transformed into pink, but gradually the conventionally classical figurative painting began to recede into the background, the shapes in Picasso’s works increasingly simplified, and the proportions were distorted. Fernanda had to put up with the mismatch: on the one hand, she had her own idea of her appearance, on the other were Pablo’s fantasies. She experienced both the African period and Les Demoiselles d’Avignon. The Lady With a Fan portrait appeared at the time of the next transformation, during the transition to pure Cubism.Approximately at the same time, the relationship between Fernanda and Pablo began to crumble. In 1907, Olivier took a 13-year-old orphan from the orphanage, but they did not get a full-fledged family, and the girl was sent back. When Picasso tasted the advent of success, he began to lose interest in Fernanda, because she was a living reminder of the difficult times. In 1912, they broke up, and the woman had to change many low-paid jobs in order to feed herself. Twenty years later, Fernanda wrote memoirs about living together with Picasso, which were published in a major Belgian newspaper in 1930, in parts. The artist, who was already at the height of his popularity then, hired lawyers to prevent the publication. As aresult, Picasso achieved his goal, and Olivier received major compensation."

            "paintingDescription": "After the First World war, Picasso changed again. The impression that plenty of \"playing\" with cubism, examining its length and breadth, the artist returned to figurative painting and refers to neo-classical techniques and subjects. In the early 20-ies in his paintings begin to appear monumental figures that Gertrude Stein jokingly dubbed \"big women\" (1, 2, 3, 4). Picture \"Two women running on the beach\" can be called, perhaps, the most famous work of this series.Picasso refuses favorite technique - the distortion of the proportions of the human body, but now this technique takes other forms. His new heroine is not like any torn and withered sufferers \"blue\"period nor translucent, air comedians \"pink\" nor stone pile geometric shapes, no fluid surreal form. If we use the analogy with the elements, the \"large woman\" is the Earth in its purest form. Despite the feeling of complete freedom and emancipation, the heroine of this picture don't look like hovering above the ground. They seem to stand on it as firmly, although it is actually barely touching her. Bright blue shades of sea and sky, the flowing hair of women, their tightly knit, resilient, amazing \"material\" of the body – all this gives the feeling of such fullness of life, which only people can experience. This, according to some critics, is the main message most post-war paintings, Picasso: that's the way you live, that's the way you feel-not about war horrors.It is believed that a major influence on the works of Picasso in this period had the events in his personal life. \"Large women\" began to appear in his paintings in a time when the artist's wife Olga Khokhlova was pregnant with his first child. Researchers believe that the impressive female body was a kind of celebration of motherhood and fertility.In 1924 the painting \"Two women running on the beach\", increased nearly 30 times, was used in the design of performances of Russian ballet of Diaghilev \"Blue train\". A copy of the executed Russian theater artist Aleksandr Shervashidze, and she was so impressed by Picasso for its accuracy that he signed it with his name.Author: Eugene Sidelnikov"

            "paintingDescription": "\"A woman in a beret and plaid dress»is bright, sharp and intense image of Marie-Therese Walter, \"the Golden Muse\" of Picasso. The portrait was created in December 1937, becoming the culmination of perhaps the most intense year in the life of the artist. Five months earlier, he created his greatest masterpiece — \"Guernica\"dedicated to the bombing of the eponymous town during the civil war in Spain. Although Picasso still continued relationship with Walter, an increasingly significant position in his life conquered another woman — Dora Maar, with whom Rodin met in 1935.It seems that through this portrait, Picasso was trying to Express their feelings towards both women. This duality is visible in the transition of the two styles — more soft, festive feel \"of the period, Marie-thérèse\" gives way to more painful cubist forms associated with politically minded Dora Maar (1937 in the same year she posed for «Weeping woman»that is now part of the collection of the Tate Modern in London).For the face of Marie-thérèse on \"Women take\" silhouette emerges, in which the artist could mean your next lover. Picasso himself said: \"The girl must be painful to see the picture that her time is running out».It is interesting to compare the evolution of portraits of Walter over the past few years. In 1932, Picasso created an extraordinarilysensual and lyrical images hislover, indicating the peak of happiness. But a dynamic \"Woman in a beret and plaid dress\" shows how much has changed in five years. Sharp cubist borders, paint, imposed rough brush strokes and black outlines give the work a strong emotional charge. This is not the voluptuous curves and smooth curves, which Picasso painted the woman who gave birth to his child. However, the portrait suggests that she still occupies a Central place in the life of the artist.More than 80 years since the creation of \"Woman in a beret and plaid dress\" did not appear on the market. After the artist's death in 1973, she moved to a private collection and only in February of 2018 was put up for sale the works of the Impressionists and modernists Sotheby's in London. Painting for 49.8 million pounds (69.2 million U.S. dollars) acquired Harry Smith, head ofthe Advisory and consulting firm Gurr Johns. Author: Vlad Maslov"

            "paintingDescription": "C Dora Maar Picasso linked the most complex and unusual relationships in his life, which was based not only passion, but also intellectual competition. She was also a painter, speaking in his native Spanish, and shared his political views. Maar even helped Picasso in the creation of his monumental paintings \"Guernica\" and was the only person captured on film the process of writing this famous painting. It was not so much a mistress, but the intellectual power that inspired Picasso to the creation of many powerful and daring portraits. And one of them \"Dora Maar with cat\" - is among the most famous works of the artist.Most of the portraits of Dora Maar in a similar technique: Picasso wrote them in a deliberately distorted manner and it's a dark color, duplicated and multiplied parts of the face and body of his beloved, made them jagged and angular (1, 2, 3). It is considered that the style of his letters was severely affected by the unfolding at that time in Europe the Second World war. Picasso and Maar met in 1936 and lived together until the end of the war in Nazi-occupied Paris, and, according to critics, the artist it is seen then the world is distorted and broken. The painting \"Dora Maar with cat\" was writtenin 1941, when the war began in France.When you create a portrait of Dora Maar seated in a chair with a kitten on his shoulder, Picasso used unusual for this period, a surprisingly bright color palette and showed amazing attention to detail. He portrayed a lover like either some kind of pagan goddess, proudly seated on a throne, or a witch with a sly glance, ready to cast a spell. The similarities emphasize the pointed hat of a woman and her long, predatory nails. And, of course, it is difficult to imagine a self-respecting witch without a black cat. By the way, that flawless manicure and exquisite hats were a kind of \"calling card\" of Dora Maar and the special pride. \"Dora Maar with cat\" wassold in 2006 at Sotheby's anonymous collector for 95,2 million dollars, and is still in the list of most expensive works of art in history.Author: Eugene Sidelnikov"
